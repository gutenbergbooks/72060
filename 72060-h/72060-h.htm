<p>The scope of the present work is to give in a concise form an account
of the principal facts relating to the structure, classification, and
life-history of Fishes. It is intended to meet the requirements of
those who are desirous of studying the elements of Ichthyology; to
serve as a book of reference to zoologists generally; and, finally,
to supply those who, like travellers, have frequent opportunities
of observing fishes, with a ready means of obtaining information.
The article on “Ichthyology,” prepared by the late Sir J. Richardson
for the eighth edition of the “Encyclopædia Britannica,” is the only
publication which has hitherto partly satisfied such requirements;
and when I undertook, some years ago, to revise, or rather rewrite
that article for the new edition of that work, it occurred to me that
I might at the same time prepare a Handbook of Ichthyology, whilst
reserving for the article an abstract so condensed as to be adapted for
the wants of the general reader.</p>

<p>From the general plan of the work I have only departed in those
chapters which deal with the Geographical Distribution of Fishes. This
is a subject which has never before been treated in a general<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[vi]</span> and
comprehensive manner, and seemed to demand particular attention. I
have, therefore, thought it right to give nominal lists of the Faunæ,
and the other details of fact on which I have based my conclusions,
although all the necessary materials may be found in my “Catalogue of
Fishes.”</p>

<p>A few references only to the numerous sources which were consulted
on the subjects of Chapters 1–12, are inserted in the text; more not
required by the beginner; he is introduced to a merely elementary
knowledge of facts well known to the advanced student.</p>

<p>With regard to the illustrations, about twenty have been prepared after
originals published by Cuvier, J. Müller, Owen, Traquair, Duméril,
Cunningham, Hasse, Poey, Siebold, and Gegenbaur. A similar number,
representing extinct fishes, have been taken, with the kind permission
of the author, from Owen’s “Palæontology.” My best thanks are due also
to the Committee of Publications of the Zoological Society, and to the
Editors of the “Annals and Magazine of Natural History,” and of the
“Journal des Museum Godeffroy,” for the loan of woodcuts illustrating
some of my papers on South American fishes and on larval forms. The
remainder of the illustrations (about three-fourths) are either
original figures, or formed part of the article on ‘Ichthyology’ in the
former edition of the “Encyclopædia Britannica.”</p>

<h2 class="smaller">INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.</h2>
</div>


<p>According to the views generally adopted at present, all those
Vertebrate animals are referred to the Class of Fishes, which living in
water, breathe air dissolved in water by means of gills or branchiæ;
whose heart consists of a single ventricle and single atrium; whose
limbs, if present, are modified into fins, supplemented by unpaired,
median fins; and whose skin is either naked, or covered with scales or
osseous plates or bucklers. With few exceptions fishes are oviparous.
However, there are not a few members of this Class which show a
modification of one or more of these characteristics, as we shall see
hereafter, and which, nevertheless, cannot be separated from it. The
distinction between the Class of Fishes and that of Batrachians is very
slight indeed.</p>

<p>The branch of Zoology which treats of the internal and external
structure of fishes, their mode of life, and their distribution in
space and time, is termed Ichthyology.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<h2 class="smaller">CHAPTER I.<br>
<span class="subhed">HISTORY AND LITERATURE.</span></h2></div>

<div class="sidenote">Aristotle.</div>

<p class="p-left">The commencement of the history of Ichthyology coincides with that
of Zoology generally. <span class="smcap">Aristotle</span> (384–322 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>)
had a perfect knowledge of the general structure of fishes, which
he clearly discriminates from the Aquatic animals with lungs and
mammæ, <i>i.e.</i> Cetaceans, and from the various groups of Aquatic
Invertebrates. He says that “the special characteristics of the true
fishes consist in the branchiæ and fins, the majority having four
fins, but those of an elongate form, as the eels, having two only.
Some, as the <i>Muræna</i>, lack the fins altogether. The Rays swim
with their whole body, which is spread out. The branchiæ are sometimes
furnished with an opercle, sometimes without one, as is the case in
the cartilaginous fishes.... No fish has hairs or feathers; most are
covered with scales, but some have a rough or smooth skin. The tongue
is hard, often toothed; and sometimes so much adherent that it seems
to be wanting. The eyes have no lids; nor are any ears or nostrils
visible, for what takes the place of nostrils is a blind cavity.
Nevertheless they have the senses of tasting, smelling, and hearing.
All have blood. All scaly fishes are oviparous, but the cartilaginous
fishes (with the exception of the Sea-devil, which Aristotle places
along with them) are viviparous. All have a heart, liver, and
gall-bladder; but kidneys and urinary bladder are absent. They vary
much in the structure of their intestines: for whilst the mullet has
a fleshy stomach like a bird, others have no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span> stomachic dilatation.
Pyloric coeca are close to the stomach, variable in number; there are
even some, like the majority of the cartilaginous fishes, which have
none whatever. Two bodies are situated along the spine, which have the
function of testicles, and open towards the vent, and which are much
enlarged in the spawning season. The scales become harder with age. Not
being provided with lungs, they have no voice, but several can emit
grunting sounds. They sleep like other animals. In the majority the
females exceed the males in size; and in the Rays and Sharks the male
is distinguished by an appendage on each side of the vent.”</p>

<p>Aristotle’s information on the habits of fishes, their migrations, mode
and time of propagation, utility, is, as far as it has been tested,
surprisingly correct. Unfortunately, only too often we lack the means
of recognising the species of which he gives a description. His ideas
of specific distinction were as vague as those of the fishermen whose
nomenclature he adopted; it never occurred to him that such popular
names are subject to change, or may be entirely lost with time, and
the difficulty of deciphering his species is further increased by the
circumstance that popular names are often applied by him to the same
fish, or that different stages of growth are designated by distinct
names. The number of fishes known to Aristotle seems to have been about
115, all of which are inhabitants of the Ægean Sea.</p>

<p>That one man should have discovered so many truths, and formed so
sure a base for Zoology, is less surprising than the fact that for
about eighteen centuries a science which seemed to offer particular
attractions to men gifted with power of observation, was no farther
advanced. Yet this is the case. Aristotle’s disciples, as well as his
successors, remained satisfied to be his copiers or commentators,
and to collect fabulous stories or vague notions. With very few
exceptions (such as <i>Ausonius</i>, who wrote a small poem, in which
he describes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span> from his own observations the fishes of the Mosel)
authors entirely abandoned original research. And it was not until
about the middle of the sixteenth century that Ichthyology made a new
step in advance by the appearance of <i>Belon</i>, <i>Rondelet</i>, and
<i>Salviani</i>, who almost simultaneously published their grand works,
by which the idea of species was established definitely and for all
times.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Belon.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">P. Belon</span> travelled in the countries bordering on the eastern
part of the Mediterranean, in the years 1547–50; he collected rich
stores of positive knowledge, which he deposited in several works. The
one most important for the progress of Ichthyology is that entitled “De
aquatilibus libri duo” (Paris 1553; small 4to.) Belon knows about 110
fishes, of which he gives rude, but generally recognisable, figures. In
his descriptions he pays regard to the classical as well as vernacular
nomenclature, and states the outward characteristics, sometimes even
the number of fin-rays, frequently also the most conspicuous anatomical
peculiarities.</p>

<p>Although Belon but rarely gives definitions of the terms used by him,
it is generally not very difficult to ascertain the limits which
he intended to assign to each division of aquatic animals. He very
properly divides them into such as are provided with blood, and into
those without it: two divisions, called in modern language Vertebrate
and Invertebrate aquatic animals. The former are classified by him
according to sizes, the further subdivisions being based on the
structure of the skeleton, mode of propagation, number of limbs, form
of the body, and on the physical character of the localities inhabited
by fishes. This classification is as follows:—</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salviani.</div>

<p class="p-left">The work of the Roman ichthyologist, <span class="smcap">H. Salviani</span> (1514–72),
is characteristic of the high social position which the author held
as the physician of three popes. Its title is “Aquatilium animalium
historia” (Rom. 1554–57, fol.) It treats exclusively of the fishes of
Italy. Ninety-two species are figured on seventy-six plates which, as
regards artistic execution, are masterpieces of that period, although
those specific characteristics which nowadays constitute the value
of a zoological drawing, were entirely overlooked by the author or
artist. No attempt is made at a natural classification, but the allied
forms generally are placed in close proximity. The descriptions are
quite equal to those given by Belon, entering much into the details of
the economy and usefulness of the several species, and were evidently
composed with the view of collecting in a readable form all that might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
prove of interest to the class of society in which the author moved.
Salviani’s work is of a high standard, most remarkable for the age in
which he lived. It could not fail to convey valuable instruction, and
to render Ichthyology popular in the country to the fauna of which it
was devoted, but it would not have advanced Ichthyology as science
generally; and in this respect Salviani is not to be compared with
Rondelet or Belon.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Rondelet.</div>

<p class="p-left"><span class="smcap">G. Rondelet</span> (1507–1557) had the great advantage over Belon in
having received a medical education at Paris, and more especially in
having gone through a complete course of instruction in anatomy as a
pupil of Guentherus of Andernach. This is conspicuous throughout his
works—“Libri de Piscibus marinis” (Lugd. 1554, fol.); and “Universæ
aquatilium historiæ pars altera” (Lugd. 1555, fol.) Nevertheless
they cannot be regarded as more than considerably enlarged editions
of Belon’s work. For although he worked independently of the latter,
and differs from him in numerous details, the system adopted by
him is characterised by the same absence of the true principles of
classification. Rondelet had a much more extensive knowledge of
details. His work is almost entirely limited to European, and chiefly
Mediterranean, forms, and comprises not less than 197 marine and 47
freshwater fishes. His descriptions are more complete and his figures
much more accurate than those of Belon; and the specific account is
preceded by introductory chapters in which he treats in a general
manner on the distinctions, the external and internal parts, and on
the economy of fishes. Like Belon, he had no conception of the various
categories of classification—for instance, confounding throughout his
work the terms “genus” and “species;” but he had intuitively a notion
of what his successors called a “species,” and his principal object was
to collect and give as much information as possible of such species.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span></p>

<p>For nearly a century the works of Belon and Rondelet remained the
standard works of Ichthyology; but this science did not remain
stationary during this period. The attention of naturalists was now
directed to the products of foreign countries, especially the Spanish
and Dutch possessions in the New World; and in Europe the establishment
of anatomical schools and academies led to the careful investigation
of the internal anatomy of the most remarkable European forms. Limited
as these efforts were as to their scope, being directed either only to
the fauna of some district, or to the dissection of a single species,
they were sufficiently numerous to enlarge the views of naturalists,
and to destroy that fatal dependency on preceding authorities which had
continued to keep in bonds the minds of even such men as Rondelet and
Belon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">W. Piso. G. Margrav.</div>

<p class="p-left">The most noteworthy of those who were active in tropical countries
are <span class="smcap">W. Piso</span> and <span class="smcap">G. Margrav</span>. They accompanied as
physicians the Dutch Governor, Prince Moritz of Nassau, to Brazil
(1637–44). Margrav especially studied the fauna of the country,
and although he died before his return to Europe, his observations
were published by his colleague, and embodied in a work “Historia
naturalis Braziliæ” (Lugd. 1648, fol.), in which the fourth book
treats of the fishes. He describes about 100 species, all of which
had been previously unknown, in a manner far superior to that of his
predecessors. The accompanying figures are not good, but nearly always
recognisable, and giving a fair idea of the form of the fish. Margrav
himself, with the aid of an artist, had made a most valuable collection
of coloured drawings of the objects observed and described by him, but
many years were allowed to pass before it was scientifically utilised
by Bloch and others.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Anatomists, 1600–1700.</div>

<p class="p-left">Of the men who left records of their anatomical researches, we
may mention <span class="smcap">Borelli</span> (1608–79), who wrote a work “De motu
animalium” (Rom. 1680, 4to), in which he explained the mechanism of
swimming, and the function of the air-bladder;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span> <span class="smcap">M. Malpighi</span>
(1628–94), who examined the optic nerve of the sword-fish; the
celebrated <span class="smcap">J. Swammerdam</span> (1637–80), who described the
intestines of numerous fishes; and <span class="smcap">J. Duverney</span> (1648–1730),
who entered into detailed researches of the organs of respiration.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A new era in the history of Ichthyology commences with <i>Ray</i>,
<i>Willughby</i>, and <i>Artedi</i>, who were the first to recognise
the true principles by which the natural affinities of animals should
be determined. Their labours stand in so intimate a connection with
each other that they represent only one stride in the progress of this
science.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Ray and Willughby</div>

<p class="p-left"><span class="smcap">J. Ray</span> (born 1628 in Essex, died 1705), was the friend and
guide of <span class="smcap">F. Willughby</span> (1635–72). They had recognised that a
thorough reform of the treatment of the vegetable and animal kingdoms
had become necessary; that the only way of bringing order into the
existing chaos was that of arranging the various forms with regard to
their structure; that they must cease to be burdened with inapplicable
passages and quotations of the ancient writers, and to perpetuate
the erroneous or vague notions of their predecessors. They abandoned
speculation, and adhered to facts only. One of the first results, and
perhaps the most important, of their method was, that having recognised
the “species” as such, they defined this term, and fixed it as the
base, from which all sound zoological knowledge has to start.</p>

<p>Although they had divided their work thus that Ray attended to the
plants principally, and Willughby to the animals, the “Historia
piscium” (Oxford, 1686, fol.), which bears Willughby’s name on the
titlepage, and was edited by Ray, is clearly their joint production. A
great part of the observations contained in it were collected during
their common journeys in Great Britain and on the Continent, and it is
no exaggeration to say that at that time these two Englishmen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span> knew the
fishes of the Continent, especially those of Germany, better than any
other Continental zoologist.</p>

<p>By the definition of fishes as animals with blood, breathing by gills,
provided with a single ventricle of the heart, covered with scales or
naked; the Cetaceans are excluded. Yet, at a later period Ray appears
to have been afraid of so great an innovation as the separation of
whales from fishes, and, therefore, he invented a definition of fish
which comprises both. The fishes proper are then arranged in the
first place according to the cartilaginous or osseous nature of the
skeleton; further subdivisions being formed with regard to the general
form of the body, the presence or absence of ventral fins, the soft or
spinous structure of the dorsal rays, the number of dorsal fins, etc.
Not less than 420 species are thus arranged and described, of which
about 180 were known to the authors from autopsy: a comparatively
small proportion, descriptions and figures still forming at that time
in a great measure a substitute for collections and museums. With the
increasing accumulation of forms the want of a fixed nomenclature is
now more and more felt.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">P. Artedi.</div>

<p class="p-left"><span class="smcap">Peter Artedi</span> would have been a great ichthyologist if Ray or
Willughby had never preceded him. But he was fully conscious of the
fact that both had prepared the way for him, and therefore he derived
all possible advantages from their works. Born in 1705 in Sweden, he
studied with Linnæus at Upsala; from an early period he devoted himself
entirely to the study of fishes, and was engaged in the arrangement and
description of the ichthyological collection of <i>Seba</i>, a wealthy
Dutchman who had formed the then perhaps richest museum, when he was
accidentally drowned in one of the canals of Amsterdam in the year
1734, at an age of twenty-nine years. His manuscripts were fortunately
rescued by an Englishman, Cliffort, and edited by his early friend
Linnæus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span></p>

<p>The work is divided into the following parts:—</p>

<p>1. In the “Bibliotheca Ichthyologica” Artedi gives a very complete list
of all preceding authors who have written on fishes, with a critical
analysis of their works.</p>

<p>2. The “Philosophia Ichthyologica” is devoted to a description of
the external and internal parts of fishes; Artedi fixes a precise
terminology of all the various modifications of the organs,
distinguishes between those characters which determine a genus and such
as indicate a species or merely a variety; in fact he establishes the
method and principles which subsequently have guided every systematic
ichthyologist.</p>

<p>3. The “Genera Piscium” contains well-defined diagnoses of forty-five
genera, for which he fixes an unchangeable nomenclature.</p>

<p>4. In the “Species Piscium” descriptions of seventy-two species,
examined by himself, are given; descriptions which even now are models
of exactitude and method.</p>

<p>5. Finally, in the “Synonymia Piscium” references to all previous
authors are arranged for every species, very much in the same manner
which is adopted in the systematic works of the present day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Linnæus.</div>

<p class="p-left">Artedi has been justly called the Father of Ichthyology. So perfect was
his treatment of the subject, that even <span class="smcap">Linnæus</span> could no more
improve it, only modify and add to it; and as far as Ichthyology is
concerned, Linnæus has scarcely done anything beyond applying binominal
terms to the species properly described and classified by Artedi.</p>

<p>Artedi had divided the fishes proper into four orders, viz.
<i>Malacopterygii</i>, <i>Acanthopterygii</i>, <i>Branchiostegi</i>,
and <i>Chondropterygii</i>, of which the third only, according to
our present knowledge, appears to be singularly heterogeneous, as it
comprises <i>Balistes</i>, <i>Ostracion</i>, <i>Cyclopterus</i>, and
<i>Lophius</i>. Linnæus, besides separating the Cetaceans entirely from
the class of fishes (at least since the 10th edition of the “Systema
Naturæ”)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span> abandoned Artedi’s order of Branchiostegi, but substituted
a scarcely more natural combination by joining it with Artedi’s
Chondropterygians, under the name of “Amphibia nantes.”</p>

<p>His classification of the genera appears in the 12th edition of the
“Systema,” thus—</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gronow and Klein.</div>

<p class="p-left">Two contemporaries of <i>Linnæus</i> attempted a systematic arrangement
of fishes; both had considerable opportunities for their study,
especially in possessing extensive collections; but neither exercised
any influence on the progress of Ichthyology. The one, <span class="smcap">L. T.
Gronow</span>, a German who resided in Holland, closely followed the
arrangements proposed by Artedi and Linnæus, and increased the
number of genera and species from the contents of his own museum. He
published two works, “Museum Ichthyologicum” (Lugd. 1754–6, fol.), and
“Zoophylacium” (Lugd. 1763–81, fol.); a posthumous work, containing
numerous excellent descriptions of new forms was published by J. E.
Gray in 1854 under the title of “Systema Ichthyologicum.” To Gronow
also is due the invention of preparing flat skins of fishes in a dry
state, and preserving them in the manner of a herbarium. The specimens
thus prepared by him belong to the oldest which have been preserved
down to our time.</p>

<p>Much less important are the ichthyological labours of <span class="smcap">J. T.
Klein</span> (1685–1759). They are embodied in five parts (<i>Missus</i>)
of a work entitled “Historia naturalis piscium” (Sedæ, 1740–9, 4to.)
He regarded a system merely as the means of recognising the various
forms of animals, not as the expression of their natural affinities;
and that method seemed to him to be the most perfect by which an animal
could be most readily determined. He eschewed all reference to minute
or anatomical characters. Hence his system is a series of the most
unnatural combinations, and we cannot be surprised that Linnæus passed
in silence over Klein’s labours.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Pupils and Successors of Linnæus</div>

<p class="p-left">The works of Artedi and Linnæus excited fresh activity, more especially
in Scandinavia, Holland, Germany, and England, such as has not been
equalled in the history of biological science either before or
after. Whilst some of the pupils and followers of Linnæus devoted
themselves to an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span> examination and study of the fauna of their native
countries, others proceeded on voyages of discovery to foreign and
distant countries. Of these latter the following may be specially
mentioned:—<i>O. Fabricius</i> worked out the Fauna of Greenland,
<i>Kalm</i> collected in North America, <i>Hasselquist</i> in Egypt
and Palestine, <i>Brünnich</i> in the Mediterranean, <i>Osbeck</i> in
Java and China, <i>Thurnberg</i> in Japan; <i>Forskål</i> examined and
described the fishes of the Red Sea; <i>Steller</i>, <i>Pallas</i>,
<i>S. T. Gmelin</i>, and <i>Güldenstedt</i> traversed nearly the whole
of the Russian Empire in Europe and Asia. Others attached themselves
as naturalists to the celebrated circumnavigators of the last century,
like the two <i>Forsters</i> (father and son), and <i>Solander</i>, who
accompanied Cook; <i>Commerson</i>, who travelled with Bougainville;
and <i>Sonnerat</i>. Numerous new and startling forms were discovered
by those men, and the foundation was laid of the knowledge of the
geographical distribution of animals.</p>

<p>Of those who studied the fishes of their native country the most
celebrated are <i>Pennant</i> (Great Britain), <i>O. F. Müller</i>
(Denmark), <i>Duhamel</i> (France), <i>Meidinger</i> (Austria),
<i>Cornide</i> (Spain), <i>Parra</i> (Cuba).</p>

<p>The materials brought together by those and other zoologists were so
numerous that, not long after the death of Linnæus, the necessity was
felt of collecting them in a compendious form. Several compilators
undertook this task; they embodied the recent discoveries in new
editions of Artedi’s and Linné’s classical works, but not possessing
either a knowledge of the subject or any critical discernment, they
only succeeded in covering those noble monuments under a mass of
confused rubbish. For Ichthyology it was fortunate that two men at
least, Bloch and Lacépède, made it a subject of long and original
research.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">M. E. Bloch.</div>

<p class="p-left"><span class="smcap">Mark Eliezer Bloch</span>, born in the year 1723 at Anspach in
Germany, practised as a physician in Berlin; he had reached<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span> an age
of fifty-six years when he commenced to write on ichthyological
subjects. To commence at his age a work in which he intended not only
to give full descriptions of the species known to him from specimens
or drawings, but also to illustrate every species in a style truly
magnificent for his time, was an undertaking of the execution of which
an ordinary man would have despaired. Yet he accomplished not only this
task, but even more, as we shall see hereafter.</p>

<p>His work consists of two divisions:—</p>

<p>1. “Oeconomische Naturgeschichte der Fische Deutschlands” (Berl.
1782–4, 4to. Plates in fol.)</p>

<p>2. “Naturgeschichte der auslændischen Fische” (Berl. 1785–95, 4to.
Plates in fol.)</p>

<p>Bloch’s work is unique, and probably will for ever remain so. Although
Cuvier fifty years later undertook a similar general work on fishes,
the subject had then become too extensive to allow of an attempt of
giving illustrations of all the species, or illustrations of a similar
size and costliness.</p>

<p>The first division of the work, which is devoted to a description of
the fishes of Germany, is entirely original, and based upon Bloch’s
own observations. His descriptions as well as figures were made from
nature, and are, with but few exceptions, still serviceable; many
continue to be the best existing in literature.</p>

<p>Bloch was less fortunate and is much less reliable in his natural
history of foreign fishes. For many of the species he had to rely
on more or less incorrect drawings and descriptions of travellers;
frequently, also, he was deceived as to the origin of specimens which
he acquired by purchase. Hence his accounts contain numerous confusing
errors which it would have been difficult to correct, if not nearly the
whole of the materials on which his work is based had been preserved in
the collections at Berlin.</p>

<p>After the completion of his Ichthyology Bloch occupied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span> himself with
systematic work. He prepared a general system of fishes, in which he
arranged not only those described in his great work, but also those
with which he had become acquainted afterwards from the descriptions of
others. The work was ably edited and published after Bloch’s death by
a philologist, <i>J. G. Schneider</i>, under the title “M. E. Blochii
Systema ichthyologiæ iconibus ex. illustratum” (Berl. 1801, 8vo.) The
number of species enumerated in it amounts to 1519. The system is
based upon the number of the fins, the various orders being termed
<i>Hendecapterygii</i>, <i>Decapterygii</i>, etc. We need not add that
an artificial method like this led to the most unnatural combinations
or severances.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lacépède.</div>

<p class="p-left">Bloch’s Ichthyology remained for many years the standard work, and,
by the great number of excellent illustrations, proved a most useful
guide to the student. But as regards originality of thought, Bloch was
far surpassed by his contemporary, <span class="smcap">B. G. E. de Lacépède</span>, born
at Agen, in France, in 1756, a man of great and general erudition, who
died as Professor of the Museum of Natural History of Paris in 1826.</p>

<p>Lacépède had to contend with great difficulties in the preparation
of his “Histoire des Poissons” (Paris, 1798–1803, 4to, in 5 vols.),
which was written during the most disturbed period of the French
Revolution. A great part of it was composed whilst the author was
separated from collections and books, and had to rely on his notes and
manuscripts only. Even the works of Bloch and other contemporaneous
authors remained unknown, or at least inaccessible, to him for a long
time. Therefore we cannot be surprised that his work abounds in all
those errors to which a compiler is subject. The same species not only
appears under two and more distinct specific names, but it sometimes
happens that the author understands so little the source from which
he derives his information that the description is referred to one
genus and the accompanying figure to another. The names of genera are
unduly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span> multiplied; and the figures with which the work is illustrated
are far inferior to those of Bloch. Thus the influence of Lacépède
on the progress of Ichthyology was infinitely less than that of his
fellow-labourer; and the labour caused to his successors by correcting
the numerous errors into which he has fallen, probably outweighs the
assistance which they derived from his work.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Anatomists.</div>

<p class="p-left">The work of the principal cultivators of Ichthyology in the period
between Ray and Lacépède was chiefly systematic and descriptive, but
also the internal organisation of fishes received attention from
more than one great anatomist. <i>Haller</i>, <i>Camper</i>, and
<i>Hunter</i>, examined the nervous system and organs of sense; and
more especially <i>Alexander Monro</i> (the son) published a classical
work, “The Structure and Physiology of Fishes explained and compared
with those of Man and other Animals” (Edinb. 1785, fol.) The electric
organs of fishes (<i>Torpedo</i> and <i>Gymnotus</i>) were examined
by <i>Réaumur</i>, <i>Allamand</i>, <i>Bancroft</i>, <i>Walsh</i>,
and still more exactly by <i>J. Hunter</i>. The mystery of the
propagation of the Eel called forth a large number of essays, and even
the artificial propagation of Salmonidæ was known and practised by
<i>Gleditsch</i> (1764).</p>

<div class="sidenote">Faunists.</div>

<p class="p-left">Bloch and Lacépède’s works were almost immediately succeeded by the
labours of <i>Cuvier</i>, but his early publications were of necessity
tentative, preliminary, and fragmentary, so that a short period elapsed
before the spirit infused by this great anatomist into Ichthyology
could exercise its influence on all workers in this field. Several
of such antecuvierian works must be mentioned on account of their
importance to our knowledge of certain Faunas: the “Descriptions
and Figures of Two Hundred Fishes collected at Vizagapatam on the
coast of Coromandel” (Lond. 1803; 2 vols. in fol.), by <i>Patrick
Russel</i>; and “An Account of the Fishes found in the River Ganges and
its branches” (Edinb. 1822; 2 vols. in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span> 4to), by <i>F. Hamilton</i>
(formerly <i>Buchanan</i>)—works distinguished by a greater accuracy
of their drawings (especially in the latter), than was ever attained
before. A “Natural History of British Fishes” was published by <i>E.
Donovan</i> (Lond. 8vo, 1802–8); and the Mediterranean Fauna formed
the study of the lifetime of <i>A. Risso</i> (“Ichthyologie de Nice.”
Paris, 1810, 8vo; and “Histoire naturelle de l’Europe Meridionale.”
Paris, 1827, 8vo). A slight beginning in the description of the fishes
of the United States was made by <i>S. L. Mitchell</i>, who published,
besides various papers, a “Memoir on the Ichthyology of New York,” in
1815.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">G. Cuvier.</div>

<p class="p-left"><span class="smcap">G. Cuvier</span> did not occupy himself with the study of fishes
merely because this class formed part of the “Règne animal,” but he
devoted himself to it with particular predilection. The investigation
of their anatomy, and especially of their skeleton, was taken up
by him at an early period, and continued until he had succeeded in
completing so perfect a framework of the system of the whole class
that his immediate successors could content themselves with filling up
those details for which their master had no leisure. Indefatigable in
examining all the external and internal characters of the fishes of a
rich collection, he ascertained the natural affinities of the infinite
variety of fishes, and accurately defined the divisions, orders,
families, and genera of the class, as they appear in the various
editions of the “Règne animal.” His industry equalled his genius: he
opened connections with almost every accessible part of the globe; not
only French travellers and naturalists, but also Germans, Englishmen,
Americans, rivalled one another to assist him with collections; and
for many years the Muséum of the Jardin des Plantes was the centre
where all ichthyological treasures were deposited. Thus Cuvier<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span> brought
together a collection the like of which had never been seen before,
and which, as it contains all the materials on which his labours
were based, must still be considered to be the most important. Soon
after the year 1820, Cuvier, assisted by one of his pupils, <span class="smcap">A.
Valenciennes</span>, commenced his great work on fishes, “Histoire
naturelles des Poissons,” of which the first volume appeared in 1828.
The earlier volumes, in which Cuvier himself took his share, bear
evidence of the freshness and love with which both authors devoted
themselves to their task. After Cuvier’s death in 1832 the work was
left entirely in the hands of Valenciennes, whose energy and interest
gradually slackened, to rise to the old standard in some parts only,
as, for instance, in the treatise on the Herring. He left the work
unfinished with the twenty-second volume (1848), which treats of the
Salmonoids. Yet, incomplete as it is, it is indispensable to the
student.</p>

<p>There exist several editions of the work, which, however, have the same
text. One, printed in 8vo, with coloured or plain figures, is the one
in common use among ichthyologists. A more luxurious edition in 4to has
a different pagination, and therefore is most inconvenient to use.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, the various parts of the work are very unequally
worked out. Many of the species are described in so masterly a
manner that a greater excellency of method can hardly be conceived.
The history of the literature of these species is entered into with
minuteness and critical discernment; but in the later volumes, numerous
species are introduced into the system without any description, or
with a few words only, comparing a species with one or more of its
congeners. Cuvier himself, at a late period of his life, seems to have
grown indifferent as to the exact definition of his species: a failing
commonly observed among Zoologists when attention to descriptive
details becomes to them a tedious task. What is more surprising is,
that a man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span> of his anatomical and physiological knowledge should have
overlooked the fact that secondary sexual characters are developed in
fishes as in any other class of animals, and that fishes undergo great
changes during growth; and, consequently, that he described almost
all such sexual forms and different stages of growth under distinct
specific and even generic names.</p>

<p>The system finally adopted by Cuvier is the following:—</p>

<p>We have to compare this system with that of Linnæus if we wish
to measure the gigantic stride Ichthyology has made during the
intervening period of seventy years. The various characters employed
for classification have been examined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span> throughout the whole class,
and their relative importance has been duly weighed and understood.
Though Linnæus had formed a category of “Amphibia nantes” for fishes
with a cartilaginous skeleton, which should coincide with Cuvier’s
“Poissons Cartilagineux,” he had failed to understand the very nature
of cartilage, apparently comprising by this term any skeletal framework
of less firmity than ordinary bone. Hence he considered <i>Lophius</i>,
<i>Cyclopterus</i>, <i>Syngnathus</i> to be cartilaginous fishes.
Adopting the position and development of the ventral fins as a
highly important character, he was obliged to associate fishes with
rudimentary and inconspicuous ventral fins, like <i>Trichiurus</i>,
<i>Xiphias</i>, etc., with the true Eels. The important category of
a “family” appears now in Cuvier’s system fully established as that
intermediate between genus and order. Important changes in Cuvier’s
system have been made and proposed by his successors, but in the main
it is still that of the present day.</p>

<p>Cuvier had extended his researches beyond the living forms, into
the field of palæontology; he was the first to observe the close
resemblance of the scales of the fossil <i>Palæoniscus</i> to
those of the living <i>Polypterus</i> and <i>Lepidosteus</i>, the
prolongation and identity of structure of the upper caudal lobe in
<i>Palæoniscus</i> and the Sturgeons, the presence of peculiar “fulcra”
on the anterior margin of the dorsal fin in <i>Palæoniscus</i> and
<i>Lepidosteus</i>: inferring from these facts that that fossil
genus was allied <i>either</i> to the Sturgeons <i>or</i> to
<i>Lepidosteus</i>. But it did not occur to him that there was a close
relationship between those recent fishes. <i>Lepidosteus</i> and, with
it, the fossil genus remained in his system a member of the order of
<i>Malacopterygii abdominales</i>.</p>

<p>It was left to <span class="smcap">L. Agassiz</span> (born 1807, died 1873) to point out
the importance of the character of the structure of the scales, and to
open a path towards the knowledge of a whole new sub-class of fishes,
the <i>Ganoidei</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span></p>

<p>Impressed with the fact that the peculiar scales of <i>Polypterus</i>
and <i>Lepidosteus</i> are common to all fossil osseous fishes down to
the chalk, he takes the structure of the scales generally as the base
for an ichthyological system, and distinguishes four orders:—</p>

<p>1. <i>Placoids.</i>—Without scales proper, but with scales of enamel,
sometimes large, sometimes small and reduced to mere points (Rays,
Sharks, and Cyclostomi, with the fossil <i>Hybodontes</i>).</p>

<p>2. <i>Ganoids.</i>—With angular bony scales, covered with a thick
stratum of enamel: to this order belong the fossil Lepidoides,
Sauroides, Pycnodontes, and Coelacanthi; the recent Polypterus,
Lepidosteus, Sclerodermi, Gymnodontes, Lophobranches, and Siluroides;
also the Sturgeons.</p>

<p>3. <i>Ctenoids.</i>—With rough scales, which have their free margins
denticulated: Chætodontidæ, Pleuronectidæ, Percidæ, Polyacanthi,
Sciænidæ, Sparidæ, Scorpænidæ, Aulostomi.</p>

<p>4. <i>Cycloids.</i>—With smooth scales, the hind margin of which
lacks denticulation: Labridæ, Mugilidæ, Scombridæ, Gadoidei, Gobiidæ,
Murænidæ, Lucioidei, Salmonidæ, Clupeidæ, Cyprinidæ.</p>

<p>We have no hesitation in affirming that if Agassiz had had an
opportunity of acquiring a more extensive and intimate knowledge of
existing fishes before his energies were absorbed in the study of
their fossil remains, he himself would have recognised the artificial
character of his classification. The distinctions between cycloid and
ctenoid scales, between placoid and ganoid fishes are vague, and can
hardly be maintained. As far as the living and post-cretacean forms
are concerned, the vantage-ground gained by Cuvier was abandoned
by him; and therefore his system could never supersede that of his
predecessors, and finally shared the fate of every classification based
on the modifications of one organ only. But Agassiz has the merit of
having opened an immense new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span> field of research by his study of the
infinite variety of fossil forms. In his principal work, “Recherches
sur les Poissons fossiles,” (Neuchatel, 1833–43, 4to, atlas in fol.),
he placed them before the world arranged in a methodical manner, with
excellent descriptions and illustrations. His power of discernment and
penetration in determining even the most fragmentary remains is truly
astonishing; and if his order of Ganoids is an assemblage of forms very
different from that as it is circumscribed now, he was at any rate the
first who recognised that such an order of fishes exists.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">J. Müller.</div>

<p class="p-left">The discoverer of the <i>Ganoidei</i> was succeeded by their explorer,
<span class="smcap">Johannes Müller</span> (born 1801, died 1858). In his classical
memoir “Ueber den Bau und die Grenzen der Ganoiden” (Berlin, 1846;
4to), he showed that the Ganoids differed from all the other osseous
fishes, and agreed with the Plagiostomes, in the structure of their
heart. By this primary character, all heterogeneous elements, as
<i>Siluroids</i>, <i>Osteoglossidæ</i>, etc., were eliminated from the
order as understood by Agassiz. On the other hand, he did not recognise
the affinity of <i>Lepidosiren</i> to the Ganoids, but established for
it a distinct sub-class, <i>Dipnoi</i>, which he placed at the opposite
end of the system. By his researches into the anatomy of the Lampreys
and Amphioxus, their typical distinctness from other cartilaginous
fishes was proved; they became the types of two other sub-classes,
<i>Cyclostomi</i> and <i>Leptocardii</i>.</p>

<p>Müller proposed several other not unimportant modifications of the
Cuvierian system; and although all cannot be maintained as the most
natural arrangements, yet his researches have given us a much more
complete knowledge of the organisation of the Teleosteous fishes,
and later enquiries have shown that, on the whole, the combinations
proposed by him require only some further modification and another
definition to render them perfectly natural.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span></p>

<p>Under the name of <i>Pharyngognathi</i> he combined fishes with
the lower pharyngeals coalesced into one bone, viz. the Labroids,
Chromides, and Scombresoces. The association of the third family with
the two former seemed to himself a somewhat arbitrary proceeding; and
it had to be abandoned again, when a number of fishes which cannot be
separated from the Acanthopterygians, were found to possess the same
united pharyngeals.</p>

<p>A more natural combination is the union of the Cod-fishes with the
Flat-fishes into the order <i>Anacanthini</i>. Flat-fishes are in fact
nothing but asymmetrical Cod-fishes. Müller separates them from the
remaining Malacopterygians by the absence of a connecting duct between
the air-bladder and oesophagus. However, it must be admitted that the
examination of those fishes, and especially of the young stages, is not
complete enough to raise the question beyond every doubt, whether the
presence or absence of that duct is an absolutely distinctive character
between Anacanths and Malacopterygians.</p>

<p>Many of the families established by Cuvier were reexamined and better
defined by Müller, as may be seen from the following outline of his
system:—</p>

<div class="sidenote">Discovery of Ceratodus.</div>

<p class="p-left">The discovery (in the year 1871) of a living representative of a
genus hitherto believed to be long extinct, <i>Ceratodus</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span> threw
a new light on the affinities of Fishes. The author who had the good
fortune of examining this fish, was enabled to show that, on the one
hand, it was a form most closely allied to <i>Lepidosiren</i>; on the
other, that it could not be separated from the Ganoid fishes, and
therefore that also <i>Lepidosiren</i> was a Ganoid: a relation pointed
at already by Huxley in a previous paper on “Devonian Fishes.” This
discovery led to further considerations<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> of the relative characters
of Müller’s sub-classes, and to the system which is followed in the
present work.</p>

<p>Having followed the development of the ichthyological system down to
the latest time, we have to retrace our steps to enumerate the most
important contributions to Ichthyology which appeared contemporaneously
with or subsequently to the publication of Cuvier and Valenciennes’s
great work. As in other branches of Zoology, activity increased almost
with every year; and for convenience’s sake we may arrange these works
in three rubrics.</p>

<p>These two works form the standard works for the student of the Fishes
of the Red Sea, and are distinguished by a rare conscientiousness and
faithfulness of the descriptions and figures; so that there is no
other part of the tropical seas, with the fishes of which we are so
intimately acquainted, as with those of the Red Sea. But these works
have a still wider range of usefulness, in as much as only a small
proportion of the fishes is limited to that area, the majority being
distributed over the Indian Ocean into Polynesia. Rüppel’s works were

<p>Unsurpassed in activity, as regards the exploration of the fish fauna
of the East Indian Archipelago, is <i>P. Bleeker</i>, a surgeon in the
service of the Dutch East Indian Government (born 1819, died 1878),
who, from the year 1840, for nearly thirty years, amassed immense
collections of the fishes of the various islands, and described them
in extremely numerous papers, published chiefly in the Journals of the
Batavian Society. When his descriptions and the arrangement of his
materials evoked some criticism, it must be remembered that, at the
time when he commenced his labours, and for many years afterwards,
he stood alone, without the aid of a previously named collection on
which to base his first researches, and without other works but that
of Cuvier and Valenciennes. He had to create for himself a method of
distinguishing species and of describing them; and afterwards it would
have been difficult for him to abandon his original method and the
principles by which he had been guided for so many years. His desire
of giving a new name to every individual, to every small assemblage
of species wherever practicable, or of changing an old name, detracts
not a little from the satisfaction with which his works would be
used otherwise. It is also surprising that a man with his anatomical
knowledge and unusual facilities should have been satisfied with the
merely external examination of the specimens. But none of his numerous
articles contain anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span> relating to the anatomy, physiology, or
habits of the fishes which came under his notice; hence his attempts
at systematic arrangement are very far from indicating an advance in
Ichthyology.</p>

<p>Soon after his return to Europe (1860) Bleeker commenced to collect the
final results of his labours in a grand work, illustrated by coloured
plates, “Atlas Ichthyologique des Indes Orientales Néerlandaises.”
(Amsterd. fol. 1862); the publication of which was interrupted by the
author’s death in 1878.</p>

<h3>III.—<span class="smcap">Anatomical Works.</span></h3>

<p>The number of authors who worked on the anatomy of fishes is almost
as great as that of faunists; and we should go beyond the limits of
the present work if we mentioned more than the most prominent and
successful. <i>M. H. Rathke</i>, <i>J. Müller</i>, <i>J. Hyrtl</i>,
and <i>H. Stannius</i> left scarcely any organ unexamined, and their
researches had a direct bearing either on the relation of the class of
fishes to the other vertebrates, or on the systematic arrangement of
the fishes themselves. <i>E. E. von Baer</i>, <i>F. de Filippi</i>,
<i>C. Vogt</i>, <i>W. His</i>, <i>W. K. Parker</i>, and <i>F. M.
Balfour</i> worked at their embryology; <i>A. Kölliker</i> and <i>G.
Pouchet</i> at their histology. The osteology was specially treated
by <i>G. Bakker</i>, <i>F. C. Rosenthal</i>, <i>L. Agassiz</i>,
and <i>C. Gegenbaur</i>; the nervous system by <i>Gottsche</i>,
<i>Philipeaux</i>, <i>Stannius</i>, <i>L. de Sanctis</i>, <i>L.
Stieda</i>, <i>Baudelot</i> and <i>Miclucho-Maclay</i>; the organ of
hearing by <i>E. H. Weber</i>, <i>C. Hasse</i>, and <i>G. Retzius</i>.
The electric fishes were examined by <i>E. Geoffroy</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span> <i>C.
Matteuci</i>, <i>P. Pacini</i>, <i>T. Bilharz</i>, and <i>Max
Schultze</i>. The development and metamorphosis of the Lamperns was
made the subject of research by <i>H. Müller</i>, <i>M. Schultze</i>,
and <i>P. Owsjannikow</i>; Müller’s examination of <i>Branchiostoma</i>
was continued by <i>J. Marcusen</i>, <i>A. Kovalevsky</i>, <i>L.
Stieda</i>, <i>W. Müller</i>, <i>C. Hasse</i>, <i>T. Huxley</i>, and
<i>F. M. Balfour</i>. The most comprehensive accounts of the anatomy of
fishes are contained in the following works:—</p>

<p>1. <i>H. Stannius</i>, “Zootomic der Fische,” 2d edit. (Berl. 1854,
8vo.)</p>

<p>2. <i>R. Owen</i>, “Anatomy of Vertebrates,” vol. i. (Lond. 1866, 8vo.)</p>

of the Vertebrate Animals.” Part I. Fishes. (Lond. 1846, 8vo.)</p>

<p>4. <i>T. Huxley</i>, “A Manual of the Anatomy of Vertebrated Animals.”
(Lond. 1871, 16mo.)</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">Latest Systematic Works.</div>

<p class="p-left">It has been mentioned above that the great work of Cuvier and
Valenciennes had been left incomplete. Several authors, therefore,
supplied detailed accounts of the orders omitted in that work.
<i>Müller</i> and <i>Henle</i> published an account of the
Plagiostomes, and <i>Kaup</i> of the Murænidæ and Lophobranchii. <i>A.
Duméril</i>, finally, commenced an “Histoire naturelle des Poissons ou
Ichthyologie générale,” of which, however, two volumes only appeared,
containing a complete account of the “Plagiostomes” (Paris, 1865,
8vo.), and of the “Ganoids and Lophobranchs.” (Paris, 1870, 8vo.)</p>

<p>So great an activity had prevailed in Ichthyology since the publication
of the “Histoire naturelle” by Cuvier and Valenciennes, and the results
of the manifold enquiries were scattered over such a multitude of
publications, that it became imperative to collect again all these
materials in one comprehensive work. This was done in the “Catalogue
of Fishes,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span> published by the Trustees of the British Museum, in eight
volumes (Lond. 1859-70). Beside the species previously described
many new forms were added, the number total of species referred
to in those volumes amounting to 8525. As regards the systematic
arrangement—Müller’s system was adopted in the main, but the
definition of the families is much modified. This, however, need not be
further entered into here, and will become sufficiently apparent in the
subsequent parts of the present work.</p>

<h2 class="smaller">CHAPTER II.<br>
<span class="subhed">TOPOGRAPHICAL DESCRIPTION OF THE EXTERNAL PARTS OF FISHES.</span></h2></div>

<div class="sidenote">Form of the body.</div>

<p class="p-left">In the body of a fish four parts are distinguished: the <i>head</i>,
<i>trunk</i>, <i>tail</i>, and the <i>fins</i>; the boundary
between the first and second being generally indicated by the
<i>gill-opening</i>, and that between the second and third by the
<i>vent</i>. The form of the body and the relative proportions of those
principal parts are subject to much variation, such as is not found in
any other class of Vertebrates. In fishes which are endowed with the
power of steady and more or less rapid locomotion, a deviation from
that form of body, which we observe in a perch, carp, or mackerel,
is never excessive. The body forms a simple, equally-formed wedge,
compressed or slightly rounded, well fitted for cleaving the water.
In fishes which are in the habit of moving on the bottom, the whole
body, or at least the head, is <i>vertically depressed</i> and
flattened; the head may be so enormously enlarged that the trunk and
tail appear merely as an appendage. In one family of fishes, the
<i>Pleuronectidæ</i> or Flat-fishes, the body is compressed into a thin
disk; they swim and move on one side only, which remains constantly
directed towards the bottom, a peculiarity by which the symmetry of
all parts of the body has been affected. A <i>lateral compression</i>
of the body, in conjunction with a lengthening of the vertical and
a shortening of the longitudinal axis, we find in fishes moving
comparatively slowly through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span> the water, and able to remain (as it
were) suspended in it. This deviation from the typical form may proceed
so far that the vertical axis greatly exceeds the longitudinal in
length; generally all the parts of the body participate in this form,
but in one kind of fish (the Sun-fish or <i>Orthagoriscus</i>) it is
chiefly the tail which has been shortened, and reduced so much as to
present the appearance of being cut off. An excessive lengthening of
the longitudinal axis, with a shortening of the vertical, occurs in
Eels and eel-like fishes, and in the so-called Band-fishes. They are
bottom-fish, capable of insinuating themselves into narrow crevices and
holes. The form of the body of these long fish is either cylindrical,
snake-like, as in the Eels and many Cod-fishes, or strongly compressed
as in the Band-fishes (<i>Trichiurus</i>, <i>Regalecus</i>, etc.) It
is chiefly the tail which is lengthened, but frequently the head and
trunk participate more or less in this form. Every possible variation
occurs between these and other principal types of form. The old
ichthyologists, even down to Linnæus, depended in great measure on them
for classification; but although often the same form of body obtains
in the same group of fishes, similarity of form by no means indicates
natural affinity; it only indicates similitude of habits and mode of
life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Eye.</div>

<p class="p-left"><i>The external parts of the Head.</i>—The <i>Eye</i> divides the head
into the <i>ante-orbital</i> and <i>post-orbital</i> portion. In most
fishes, especially in those with a compressed head, it is situated
on the side and in the anterior half of the length of the head; in
many, chiefly those with a depressed head, it is directed upwards, and
sometimes situated quite at the upper side; in very few, the eyes look
obliquely downwards. In the Flat-fishes both eyes are on the same side
of the head, either the right or the left, always on that which is
directed towards the light, and coloured.</p>

<p>Fishes in general, compared with other Vertebrata, have large eyes.
Sometimes these organs are enormously enlarged,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span> their great size
indicating that the fish is either nocturnal, or lives at a depth to
which only a part of the sun’s rays penetrate. On the other hand, small
eyes occur in fishes inhabiting muddy places, or great depths to which
scarcely any light descends, or in fishes in which the want of an organ
of sight is compensated by the development of other organs of sense.
In a few fishes, more particularly in those inhabiting caves or the
greatest depths of the ocean, the eyes have become quite rudimentary
and hidden under the skin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Snout.</div>

<p class="p-left">In the <i>ante-orbital</i> portion of the head, or the <i>Snout</i>,
are situated the mouth and the nostrils.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mouth.</div>

<p class="p-left">The <i>Mouth</i> is formed by the intermaxillary and maxillary
bones, or by the intermaxillary only in the upper jaw, and by the
mandibulary bone in the lower. These bones are either bare or covered
by integument, to which frequently labial folds or lips are added.
As regards form, the mouth offers as many variations as the body
itself, in accordance with the nature of the food, and the mode of
feeding. It may be narrow, or extremely wide and cleft to nearly the
hind margin of the head; it may be semi-elliptical, semicircular, or
straight in a transverse line; it may be quite in front of the snout
(<i>anterior</i>), or at its upper surface (<i>superior</i>), or at its
lower (<i>inferior</i>), or extending along each side <i>(lateral</i>);
sometimes it is subcircular, organised for sucking. The jaws of some
fishes are modified into a special weapon of attack (Sword-fish,
Saw-fish); in fact, throughout the whole class of fishes the jaws are
the only organ specialised for the purpose of attacking; weapons on
other parts of the body are purely defensive.</p>

<p>Both jaws may be provided with skinny appendages, <i>barbels</i>,
which, if developed and movable, are sensitive organs of touch.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nostrils.</div>

<p class="p-left">In the majority of fishes the <i>Nostrils</i> are a double opening on
each side of the upper surface of the snout; the openings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span> of each side
being more or less close together. They lead into a shallow groove;
and only in one family (the Myxinoids) perforate the palate. In this
family, as well as in the Lampreys, the nasal aperture is single. In
many Eels the openings are lateral, the lower perforating the upper
lip. In the Sharks and Rays (Fig. <a href="#fig1">1</a>, p. 34) they are at the lower
surface of the snout, and more or less confluent; and, finally, in the
Dipnoi and other Ganoids, one at least is within the labial boundary of
the mouth.</p>

<p>The space across the forehead, between the orbits, is called
the <i>interorbital</i> space; that below the orbit, the
<i>infraorbital</i> or <i>sub-orbital</i> region.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gill-cover.</div>

<p class="p-left">In the <i>post-orbital</i> part of the head there are distinguished,
at least in most Teleosteous Fishes and many Ganoids, (Fig. <a href="#fig24">24</a>) the
<i>præoperculum</i>, a sub-semicircular bone, generally with a free and
often serrated or variously-armed margin; the <i>operculum</i>, forming
the posterior margin of the gill-opening, and the <i>sub-operculum</i>
and <i>interoperculum</i> along its inferior margin. All these bones,
collectively called <i>opercles</i>, form the <i>gill-cover</i>, a
thin bony lamella covering the cavity containing the gills. Sometimes
they are covered with so thin a membrane that the single bones may
be readily distinguished; sometimes they are hidden under a thick
integument. In some cases the interoperculum is rudimentary or entirely
absent (Siluroids).</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gill-opening.</div>

<p class="p-left">The <i>Gill-opening</i> is a foramen, or a slit behind or below
the head, by which the water which has been taken up through the
mouth for the purpose of breathing is again expelled. This slit may
extend from the upper end of the operculum all round the side of
the head to the symphysis of the lower jaw; or it may be shortened
and finally reduced to a small opening on any part of the margin of
the gill-cover. Sometimes (<i>Symbranchus</i>) the two openings,
thus reduced, coalesce, and form what externally appears as a single
opening only. The margin of the gill-cover is provided with a cutaneous
fringe,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span> in order to more effectually close the gill-opening; and
this fringe is supported by one or several or many bony rays, the
<i>branchiostegals</i>. The space on the chest between the two
rami of the lower jaw and between the gill-openings is called the
<i>isthmus</i>.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="fig2" style="max-width: 600px">

     alt="">
     <p class="p0 center smaller">Fig. 2.—Head of <i>Mordacia mordax</i>, showing the
single nostril, and seven branchial openings.</p>
  </div>

<p>The Sharks and Rays differ from the Teleosteous and Ganoid fishes in
having five branchial slits (six or seven in <i>Hexanchus</i> and
<i>Heptanchus</i>), which are lateral in the Sharks, and at the lower
surface of the head in the Rays (Fig. <a href="#fig1">1</a>, p. 34). In Myxine only the
gill-opening is at a great distance from the head; it is either single
in this family (Cyclostomi), or there are six and more on each side
(Fig. <a href="#fig2">2</a>).</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tail.</div>

<p class="p-left">In the <i>Trunk</i> are distinguished the <i>back</i>, the
<i>sides</i>, and the <i>abdomen</i>. It gradually passes in all fishes
into the <i>Tail</i>; the termination of the abdominal cavity and the
commencement of the tail being generally indicated by the position
of the vent. The exceptions are numerous: not only certain abdominal
organs, like the sexual, may extend to between the muscles of the tail,
but the intestinal tract itself may pass far backwards, or, singularly,
it may be reflected forwards, so that the position of the vent may be
either close to the extremity of the tail or to the foremost part of
the trunk.</p>

<p>In many fishes the greater part of the tail is surrounded by the
fins, leaving only a small portion (between dorsal, caudal, and anal
fins) finless; this part is called the <i>free portion</i> or the
<i>peduncle</i> of the tail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Fins.</div>

<p class="p-left">The <i>Fins</i> are divided into <i>vertical</i> or <i>unpaired</i>,
and into <i>horizontal</i> or <i>paired fins</i>. Any of them may
be present or absent; and their position, number, and form are most
important guides in determining the affinities of fishes.</p>

<p>The <i>vertical</i> fins are situated in the median dorsal line, from
the head to the extremity of the tail, and in the ventral line of the
tail. In fishes in which they are least developed or most embryonic,
the vertical fin appears as a simple fold of the skin surrounding the
extremity of the tail In its further progress of development in the
series of fishes, it gradually extends more forwards, and may reach
even the head and vent. Even in this embryonic condition the fin is
generally supported by fine rays, which are the continuations of, or
articulated to, other stronger rays supported by the processes or
apophyses of the vertebral column. This form of the vertical fin is
very common, for instance in the Eels, many Gadoid, Blennioid and
Ganoid fishes in which, besides, the rays have ceased to be simple
rods, showing more or less numerous joints (simple <i>articulated</i>
rays; Fig. <a href="#fig3">3</a>). <i>Branched</i> rays are dichotomically split, the
joints increasing in number towards the extremity.</p>

<p>The continuity of the vertical fin, however, is interrupted in the
majority of fishes; and three fins then are distinguished: one in the
dorsal line—the <i>dorsal</i> fin; one in the ventral line behind the
anus—the <i>anal</i> fin; and one confined to the extremity of the
tail—the <i>caudal</i> fin.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="fig3" style="max-width: 300px">

  <li>3. Simple articulated ray (soft).</li>
  <li>4. Branched ray (soft).]</li>
</ul>
  </div>

<p>The <i>caudal</i> fin is rarely symmetrical, so that its upper
half would be equal to its lower; the greatest degree of asymmetry
obtains in fishes with heterocercal termination of the vertebral
column (see subsequently, Figs. <a href="#fig31">31</a>, <a href="#fig41">41</a>). In fishes in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span> which it is
nearly symmetrical it is frequently prolonged into an upper and lower
<i>lobe</i>, its hind margin being concave or more or less deeply
excised; in others the hind margin is rounded, and when the middle rays
greatly exceed in length the outer ones the fin assumes a pointed form.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="fig4" style="max-width: 600px">

     <p class="p0 center smaller">Fig. 4.—Labrax lupus (Bass), an Acanthopterygian with
anterior spinous, and posterior soft dorsal fin.</p>
  </div>

<p>Many and systematically important differences are observed in
the <i>dorsal</i> fin, which is either spiny-rayed (spinous)
(<i>Acanthopterygian</i>), or soft-rayed (<i>Malacopterygian</i>). In
the former, a smaller or greater number of the rays are simple and
without transverse joints; they may be flexible, or so much osseous
matter is deposited in them that they appear hard and truly spinous
(Fig. <a href="#fig3">3</a>); these spines form always the anterior portion of the fin,
which is detached from, or continuous with, the remaining jointed rays.
The spines can be erected or depressed at the will of the fish; if in
the depressed position the spines cover one another completely, their
points lying in the same line, the fish is called <i>homacanth</i>;
but if the spines are asymmetrical, alternately broader on one side
than on the other, the fish is called <i>heteracanth</i>. The spinous
division, as well as the one consisting of jointed rays, may again be
subdivided. In the <i>Malacopterygian</i> type all the rays remain
jointed; indeed, sometimes the foremost ray, with its preceding short
supports, is likewise ossified, and a hard spine, but the articulations
can nearly always be distinctly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span> traced. Sometimes the dorsal fin of
Malacopterygian fishes is very long, extending from the head to the
end of the tail, sometimes it is reduced to a few rays only, and in
a few cases it is entirely absent. In addition to the rayed dorsal
fin, many Malacopterygian fishes (as the Salmonoids, many Siluroids,
Scopeloids, etc.) have another of greater or lesser extent, without any
rays; and as always fat is deposited within this fold, it is called a
<i>fatty</i> fin (<i>pinna adiposa</i>).</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="fig5" style="max-width: 650px">

     <p class="p0 center smaller">Fig. 5.—Saurus undosquamis, a Malacopterygian with

  </div>

<p>The <i>anal</i> fin is built on the same plan as the dorsal, and
may be single or plural, long or short, or entirely absent; in
Acanthopterygians its foremost rays are frequently simple and spinous.</p>

<p>The <i>horizontal</i> or <i>paired</i> fins consist of two pairs: the
pectorals and ventrals.</p>

<p>The <i>pectoral</i> fins (with their osseous supports) are the
homologues of the anterior limbs of the higher Vertebrata. They are
always inserted immediately behind the gill-opening; either symmetrical
with a rounded posterior margin, or asymmetrical, with the upper rays
longest and strongest; in Malacopterygians with a dorsal spine the
upper pectoral ray is frequently developed into a similar defensive
weapon.</p>

<p>The <i>ventral</i> fins are the homologues of the hind-limbs, and
inserted on the abdominal surface, either behind the pectorals
(<i>Pisces</i> s. <i>Pinnæ abdominales</i>), or below them
<i>(Pisces</i> s. <i>Pinnæ thoracicæ</i>), or in advance of them
(<i>Pisces</i> s. <i>Pinnæ jugulares</i>). They are generally narrow,
composed of a small number of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span> rays, the outer of which is frequently
osseous. In some small groups of fishes, like the Gobies, the fins
coalesce and form a suctorial disk.</p>

  </div>

<p>For the definition of the smaller systematic groups, and the
determination of species, the numbers of the spines and rays are
generally of the greatest importance. This holds good, especially
for the ventral rays, by the number of which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span> the Acanthopterygian
affinities of a fish can nearly always be determined. The numbers of
the dorsal and anal rays generally correspond to the number of vertebræ
in a certain portion of the spine, and are therefore constant specific,
generic, or even family characters; but when their number is very
great, a proportionally wide margin must be allowed for variation, and
the taxinomic value of this character becomes uncertain. The numbers of
the pectoral and caudal rays are rarely of any account.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Function of the Fins.</div>

<p class="p-left">The fins are organs of motion; but it is chiefly the tail and the
caudal fin by which the fish impels itself forward. To execute
energetic locomotion the tail and caudal fin are strongly bent,
with rapidity, alternately towards the right and left; whilst a
gentle motion forwards is effected by a simple undulating action of
the caudal fin, the lobes of which act like the blades of a screw.
Retrograde motions can be made by fish in an imperfect manner only,
by forward-strokes of the pectoral fins. When the fish wants to
turn towards the left, he gives a stroke of the tail towards the
right, the right pectoral acting simultaneously, whilst the left
remains ad-pressed to the body. Thus the pectoral fins assist in the
progressive motions of the fish, but rather directing its course than
acting as powerful propellers. The chief function of the paired fins is
to maintain the balance of the fish in the water, which is always the
most unsteady where there is no weight to sink it: when the pectoral
of one side, or the pectoral and ventral of the same side are removed,
the fish loses its balance and falls on the side opposite; when both
pectorals are removed, the fish’s head sinks; on removal of the dorsal
and anal fins the motion of the fish assumes a zig-zag course. A fish
deprived of all fins, as well as a dead fish, floats with the belly
upwards, the back being the heavier part of the body.</p>

<p>In numerous groups of fishes which live in mud, or are enabled to pass
a longer or shorter time in soil periodically<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span> dried and hardened
during the hot season, forms occur entirely devoid of, or with only
rudimentary, ventral fins (Cyprinodon, Ophiocephalidæ, Galaxiidæ,
Siluridæ). The chief function of these fins being to balance the body
of the fish whilst swimming, it is evident that in fishes moving during
a great part of their life over swampy ground, or through more or less
consistent mud, this function of the ventral fins ceases, and that
nature can readily dispense with these organs altogether.</p>

<p>In certain fishes the shape and function of the fins are considerably
modified: thus, in the Rays, locomotion is almost entirely effected
and regulated by the broad and expanded pectoral fins acting with an
undulatory motion of their margins, similar to the undulations of the
long vertical fins of the Flat-fishes; in many Blennies the ventral
fins are adapted for walking on the sea-bottom; in some Gobioids
(<i>Periophthalmus</i>), Trigloids, Scorpænioids, and Pediculati, the
pectoral fins are perfect organs of walking; in the Gobies, Cyclopteri,
and Discoboli the ventral fins are transformed into an adhesive disk,
and finally in the Flying-fish, in which the pectorals act as a
parachute. In the Eels and other snake-like fishes, the swimming as
well as the gliding motions are effected by several curvatures of the
body, alternate towards the right and left, resembling the locomotion
of Snakes. In the <i>Syngnathi</i> (Pipe-fishes) and <i>Hippocampi</i>,
whose body admits of but a slight degree of lateral curvature, and
whose caudal fin is generally small, if present at all, locomotion is
very limited, and almost wholly dependent on the action of the dorsal
fin, which consists of a rapid undulating movement.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Skin and Scales.</div>

<p class="p-left">The <i>skin</i> of fishes is either covered with scales, or naked, or
provided with more or less numerous scutes of various forms and sizes.
Some parts, like the head and fins, are more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span> frequently naked than
scaly. All fishes provided with electric organs, the majority of Eels,
and the Lampreys, are naked. <i>Scales</i> of fishes are very different
from those of Reptiles; the latter being merely folds of the cutis,
whilst the scales of fishes are distinct horny elements, developed
in grooves or pockets of the skin, like hairs, nails, or feathers.
Very small or rudimentary scales are extremely thin, homogeneous in
structure, and more or less imbedded in the skin, and do not cover each
other. When more developed, they are imbricated (arranged in the manner
of tiles), with the posterior part extruded and free, the surface of
the anterior portion being usually covered by the skin to a greater or
less extent. On their surface (Figs. <a href="#fig10">10</a> and <a href="#fig11">11</a>) may be observed a very
fine striation concentric and parallel to the margin, and coarser striæ
radiating from a central point towards the hind margin. Scales without
a covering of enamel, with an entire (not denticulated) posterior
margin, and with a concentric striation, are called <i>Cycloid</i>
scales. <i>Ctenoid</i> scales (Figs. <a href="#fig12">12–15</a>) are generally thicker,
and provided with spinous teeth on the posterior edges of the layers
of which the scale consists. In some species only the layer nearest
to the margin is provided with denticulations (Fig. <a href="#fig14">14</a>). Scales, the
free surface of which is spiny, and which have no denticulation on the
margin, have been termed <i>Sparoid</i> scales; but their distinction
from ctenoid scales is by no means sharp, and there are even
intermediate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span> forms between the cycloid and ctenoid types. Both kinds
of scales may occur not only in species of the same genus of fishes,
but in the same fish.</p>

  </div>

<p><i>Ganoid</i> scales are hard and bony, covered with a layer of
enamel; they are generally rhombic or quadrangular, rarely rounded and
imbricate; and arranged in oblique rows, those of one row being linked
together by an articulary process. This type of scales, common in
fossil Ganoid fishes, occurs among recent fishes in <i>Lepidosteus</i>
and <i>Polypterus</i> only.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span></p>

<p>Finally, in Sharks, the Balistidæ, and others, true scales are absent
and replaced by the ossified papillæ of the cutis, which give the
surface the appearance of fine-grained chagreen. These generally small
bodies, as well as the large osseous scutes of the Rays, Sturgeons,
etc., have been comprised under the common name <i>Placoid</i> scales;
a term which deservedly is being abandoned.</p>

<p>Along the side of the body of osseous fishes runs a series of
perforated scales, which is called the <i>lateral line</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig21">21</a>).
The perforating duct is simple at its base, and may be also simple at
its outer opening (Fig. <a href="#fig19">19</a>), or (and this is frequently the case) the
portion on the free surface of the scale is ramified (Fig. <a href="#fig20">20</a>). The
lateral line runs from the head to the tail, sometimes reaching the
caudal fin, sometimes stopping in front of it, sometimes advancing over
its rays. It is nearer to the dorsal profile in some fishes than in
others. Some species have several lateral lines, the upper one coasting
the dorsal, the lower the abdominal outline, one running along the
middle as usual.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span> The scales of the lateral line are sometimes larger
than the others, sometimes smaller, sometimes modified into scutes,
sometimes there are no other scales beside them, the rest of the body
being naked. The foramina of the lateral line are the outlets of a
muciferous duct which is continued on to the head, running along the
infraorbital bones, and sending off a branch into the præopercular
margin and mandible. In many fishes, as in many Sciænoids, Gadoids,
and in numerous deep-sea fishes, the ducts of this muciferous system
are extraordinarily wide, and generally filled with mucus, which
is congealed or contracted in specimens preserved in spirits, but
swells again when the specimens are immersed in water. This system is
abundantly provided with nerves, and, therefore, has been considered
to be the seat of a sense peculiar to fishes, but there cannot be any
doubt that its function is the excretion of mucus, although probably
mucus is excreted also from the entire surface of the fish.</p>

<p>The scales, their structure, number and arrangement, are an important
character for the determination of fishes; in most scaly fishes they
are arranged in oblique transverse series; and as the number of scales
in the lateral line generally corresponds to the number of transverse
series, it is usual to count the scales in that line. To ascertain
the number of longitudinal series of scales, the scales are counted
in one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span> the transverse series, generally in that running from the
commencement of the dorsal fin, or the middle of the back to the
lateral line, and from the lateral line down to the vent or ventral
fin, or middle of the abdomen.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>The scales of many fishes are modified for special purposes, especially
to form weapons of defence or a protective armour, but the details of
such modifications are better mentioned under the several families in
which they occur. All scales are continually growing and wasting away
on the surface, and it seems that some fish, at least,—for instance,
Salmonoids—“shed” them periodically; during the progress of this
shedding the outlines of the scales are singularly irregular.</p>

<h2 class="smaller">CHAPTER III.<br>
<span class="subhed">TERMINOLOGY AND TOPOGRAPHY OF THE SKELETON.</span></h2></div>

<p>In order to readily comprehend the subsequent account of the
modifications of the skeleton in the various sub-classes and groups of
Fishes, the student has to acquaint himself with the terms used for the
numerous bones of the fish skeleton, as well as with their relative
position. The skeleton of any of the more common kinds of osseous fish
may serve for this purpose; that of the Perch is chosen here.</p>

<p>The series of bones constituting the axis of the body, and destined to
protect the spinal chord and some large longitudinal blood-vessels,
is called the <i>vertebral</i> or <i>spinal column</i>; the single
bones are the <i>vertebræ</i>. The <i>skull</i> consists of the bones
surrounding the brain and organs of sense, and of a number of arches
suspended from it, to support the commencement of the alimentary canal
and the respiratory organs.</p>

<p>The <i>vertebra</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig22">22</a>) consists of a body or <i>centrum</i>
(<i>c</i>), with a concave anterior and posterior surface, and
generally of several <i>processes</i> or <i>apophyses</i>, as—1.
Two <i>neurapophyses</i> (<i>na</i>), which, on the dorsal side,
rising upwards, form the <i>neural arch</i> over the canal, in which
the spinal chord is lodged. 2. Two <i>parapophyses</i> (<i>pa</i>)
usually projecting from the lower part of the sides of the body,
or two <i>hæmapophyses</i> (<i>ha</i>) which actually coalesce to
form on the ventral side the hæmal canal for a large trunk of the
vascular system.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span> 3. A <i>neural spine</i> (<i>ns</i>), which crowns
the neurapophyses, or is interposed between their tips. 4. A <i>hæmal
spine</i> (<i>hs</i>), having the same relation to the hæmapophyses.
5. Two <i>pleurapophyses</i> or floating <i>ribs</i>, suspended from,
or from the base of, the parapophyses. 6. In most fishes the neural
arches are connected together by articular or oblique processes,
<i>zygapophyses</i> (<i>za</i>), which are developed from the base of
each neurapophysis.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="fig22" style="max-width: 413px">

     <p class="p0 center smaller">Fig. 22.—Side and Front view of Fish-vertebra.</p>
  </div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span></p>

<p>The vertebræ are either <i>abdominal</i> or <i>caudal</i> vertebræ, the
coalescence of the parapophyses into a complete hæmal ring, and the
suspension of the anal fin generally forming a sufficiently well-marked
boundary between abdominal and caudal regions (Fig. <a href="#fig23">23</a>). In the Perch
there are twenty-one abdominal and as many caudal vertebræ. The centrum
of the first vertebra or atlas is very short, with the apophyses
scarcely indicated, and lacking ribs like the succeeding vertebra. All
the other abdominal vertebræ, with the exception of the last or two
last, are provided with ribs, many of which are bifid (72). A series of
flat spines (74), called <i>interneurals</i>, to which the spines and
rays of the dorsal fins are articulated, are supported by the neural
spines, the strength of the neurals and interneurals corresponding
to that of the <i>dermal</i> spines (75). The caudal vertebræ differ
from the abdominal in having the hæmapophyseal elements converted into
spines similar to the neurals, the anterior being likewise destined to
support a series of <i>interhæmals</i> (79), to which the anal rays are
articulated. The last and smallest caudal vertebra articulates with the
<i>hypural</i> (70), a fan-like bone, which, together with the dilated
hindmost neural and hæmal elements, supports the caudal rays.</p>

<p>Looking at a perch’s <i>skull</i> from the side (Fig. <a href="#fig24">24</a>), the most
superficial bones will be found to be those of the jaws, a chain of
thin bones round the lower half of the eye, and the opercles.</p>

<p>The anterior margin of the upper jaw is formed by the
<i>intermaxillary</i> or <i>premaxillary</i> (17) which bears teeth,
terminates in a pedicle above, to allow of a forward sliding motion of
the jaw, and is dilated into a flat triangular process behind, on which
leans the second bone of the upper jaw, the <i>maxillary</i> (18). This
bone is toothless, articulates with the vomer and palatine bone, and is
greatly dilated towards its distal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span> extremity. Both the maxillary and
intermaxillary lie and move parallel to each other, being connected by
a narrow membrane; in many other fishes their relative position is very
different.</p>

<p>The <i>mandible</i> or lower jaw consists of a right and left ramus;
their union by a ligament in front is called <i>symphysis</i>. Each
ramus is formed of several pieces; that which, by a sigmoid concavity
articulates with the quadrate, is the <i>articulary</i> bone (35);
it sends upwards a coronoid process, to which a ligament from the
maxillary and the masticatory muscles are attached; and forwards a
long-pointed process, to be sheathed in the deep notch of the anterior
piece. A small separate piece (36) at the lower posterior angle of
the mandible is termed <i>angular</i>. The largest piece (34) is
tooth-bearing, and hence termed <i>dentary</i>; at its inner surface it
is always deeply excavated, to receive a cylindrical cartilage, called
<i>Meckel’s cartilage</i>, the remains of an embryonic condition of
the jaw, the articulary and angular being but ossified parts of it.
In other <i>Teleostei</i> this number is still more increased by a
<i>splenial</i> and other bones.</p>

<p>The <i>infraorbital</i> ring of bones (Fig. <a href="#fig23">23</a>, <sup>19</sup>) consists of
several (four) pieces, of which the anterior is the largest, and
distinguished as <i>præorbital</i>.</p>

<p>The so-called <i>præoperculum</i> (30) belongs rather to the bones of
the suspensorium of the mandible, presently to be described, than to
the opercles proper. It is narrow, strong, angularly bent, so as to
consist of a vertical and horizontal limb, with an incompletely closed
canal running along both limbs. As it is quite a superficial bone, and
frequently armed with various spines, its form and configuration form
an important item in the descriptive details of many fishes.</p>

<p>The principal piece of the gill-cover is the <i>operculum</i> (28),
triangular in shape, situated behind, and movably united with, the
vertical limb of the præoperculum. There is an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span> articulary cavity at
its upper anterior angle for its junction with the hyomandibular. The
oblong lamella below the operculum is the <i>sub-operculum</i> (32),
and the one in front of this latter, below the horizontal limb of the
præoperculum, is the <i>interoperculum</i> (33), which is connected by
ligament with the angular piece of the lower jaw, and is also attached
to the outer face of the hyoid, so that the gill-covers cannot open or
shut without the hyoid apparatus executing a corresponding movement.</p>

<p>The chain of flat bones which, after the removal of the temporal
muscles, appear arranged within the inner concavity of the præoperculum
(Fig. <a href="#fig24">24</a>), are comprised with the latter under the common name of
<i>mandibulary suspensorium</i>. They connect the mandible with the
cranium. The uppermost, the <i>epitympanic</i> or <i>hyomandibular</i>
(23), is articulated by a double articulary head with the mastoid
and posterior frontal. Another articulary head is destined for
the opercular joint. The <i>mesotympanic</i> or <i>symplectic</i>
(31) appears as a styliform prolongation of the lower part of the
hyomandibular; is entirely cartilaginous in the young, but nearly
entirely ossified in the adult. The position of this bone is
noteworthy, because, directly inwards of its cartilaginous junction
with the hyomandibular, there is situated the uppermost piece of
the hyoid arch, the stylohyal. The next bone of the series is the
<i>pretympanic</i> or <i>metapterygoid</i> (27), a flat bone forming a
bridge towards the pterygoid, and not rarely absent in the teleosteous
sub-class. Finally, the large triangular <i>hypo-tympanic</i> or
<i>quadrate</i> (26) has a large condyle for the mandibulary joint.</p>

<p>The palatine arch (Fig. <a href="#fig26">26</a>) connects the suspensorium with the
anterior extremity of the skull, and is formed by three bones: the
<i>entopterygoid</i> (25), an oblong and thin bone attached to the
inner border of the palatine and pterygoid, and increasing the surface
of the bony roof of the mouth towards the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span> median line; it constitutes
also the floor of the orbit. The <i>pterygoid</i> (24) (or <i>os
transversum</i>) starts from the quadrate, and is joined by suture to
the <i>palatine</i>, which is toothed, and reaches to the vomer and
anterior frontal.</p>

<p>In the occipital region there are distinguished the
<i>basi-occipital</i> (5), readily recognised by the conical
excavation corresponding and similar to that of the atlas, with
which it is articulated through the intervention of a capsule filled
with a gelatinous substance (the remains of the notochord); the
<i>exoccipitals</i> (10), articulated, one on each side, to the
basi-occipital, and expanding on the upper surface of that bone, so as
to meet and support the spinal column; a superficial thin lamella (13),
suturally connected with the exoccipitals, not constant in fishes,
and erroneously believed by Cuvier to be the <i>petrosal</i> (<i>os
petrosum</i>) of higher animals; further, the <i>paroccipitals</i> (9),
which are wedged in between the exoccipitals and <i>supraoccipital</i>.
This last bone (8) forms the key of the arch over the occipital
foramen, and raises a strong high crest from the whole length of its
mesial line; a transverse supraoccipital ridge, coming from each side
of the base of this spine runs outwards laterally to the external
angles of the bone. The supraoccipital separates the parietals, and
forms a suture with the frontals.</p>

<p>In front of the basi-occipital the base of the skull is formed by
the <i>basisphenoid</i> (<i>parasphenoid</i> of Huxley) (6). This
very long and narrow bone extends from the basi-occipital beyond the
brain-capsule to between the orbits, where it forms the support of the
fibro-membranous interorbital septum. Anteriorly it is connate with
another long hammer-shaped bone (16), the <i>vomer</i>, the head of
which marks the anterior end of the palate, and is beset with teeth.
The <i>alisphenoids</i> (11) are short broad bones, rising from the
basisphenoid; their posterior margins are suturally connected with the
anterior of the basi- and exoccipitals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span></p>

<p>The formation of the posterior part of the side of the skull is
completed by the <i>mastoid</i> and <i>parietal</i> bones. The former
(12) projects outwards and backwards farther than the paroccipital,
forming the outer strong process of the side of the cranium. This
process lodges on its upper surface one of the main ducts of the
muciferous system, and affords the base of articulation to a part of
the hyomandibular. Its extremity gives attachment to the strong tendon
of the dorso-lateral muscles of the trunk. The <i>parietals</i> (7)
are flat bones, of comparatively much smaller extent than in higher
Vertebrates, and separated from each other by the anterior prolongation
of the supraoccipital.</p>

<p>The anterior wall of the brain-capsule (or the posterior of the
orbit) is formed by the <i>orbitosphenoids</i> (14), between which,
superiorly, the olfactory nerves, and inferiorly, the optic, pass out
of the cranium. In addition to this paired bone, the Perch and many
other fishes possess another single bone (15),—the <i>os sphenoideum
anterius</i> of Cuvier, <i>ethmoid</i> of Owen, and <i>basisphenoid</i>
of Huxley; it is Y-shaped, each lateral branch being connected with an
orbito-sphenoid, whilst the lower branch rests upon the long basal bone.</p>

<p>A cartilage, the substance of which is thickest above the vomer,
and which extends as a narrow stripe along the interorbital septum,
represents the <i>ethmoid</i> of higher Vertebrata; the olfactory
nerves run along, and finally perforate it.</p>

<p>There remain, finally, the bones distinguishable on the upper surface
of the skull; the largest, extending from the nasal cavities to the
occipital, are the <i>frontal</i> bones (1), which also form the upper
margin of the orbit. The <i>postfrontals</i> (4) are small bones placed
on the supero-posterior angle of the orbit, and serving as the point
from which the infraorbital ring is suspended. The <i>pre-frontals</i>
(2), also small, occupy the anterior margin of the orbit. A pair of
small tubiform bones (20), the <i>turbinals</i>, occupy the foremost
part of the snout, in front of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span> the frontals, and are separated from
each other by intervening cartilage.</p>

<p>After removal of the gill-cover and mandibulary suspensorium, the hyoid
arch, which encloses the branchial apparatus, and farther behind,
the humeral arch are laid open to view (Fig. <a href="#fig25">25</a>). These parts can be
readily separated from the cranium proper.</p>

<p>The <i>hyoid arch</i> is suspended by a slender styliform bone, the
<i>stylohyal</i> (29), from the hyomandibulars; it consists of three
segments, the <i>epihyal</i> (37), <i>ceratohyal</i> (38), which is
the longest and strongest piece, and the <i>basihyal</i>, which is
formed by two juxtaposed pieces (39, 40). Between the latter there is
a median styliform ossicle (41), extending forwards into the substance
of the tongue, called <i>glossohyal</i> or <i>os linguale</i>; and
below the junction of the two hyoid branches there is a vertical
single bone (42), expanded along its lower edge, which, connected by
ligament with the anterior extremity of the humeral arch, forms the
<i>isthmus</i> separating the two gill-openings. This bone is called
the <i>urohyal</i>. Articulated or attached by ligaments to the epihyal
and ceratohyal are a number of sword-shaped bones or rays (43), the
<i>branchiostegals</i>, between which the branchiostegal membrane is
extended.</p>

<p>The <i>branchial arches</i> (Figs. <a href="#fig25">25</a> and <a href="#fig27">27</a>) are enclosed within
the hyoid arch, with which they are closely connected at the base.
They are five in number, of which four bear gills, whilst the fifth
(56) remains dwarfed, is beset with teeth, and called the <i>lower
pharyngeal</i> bone. The arches adhere by their lower extremities to
a chain of ossicles (53, 54, 55), <i>basibranchials</i>, and, curving
as they ascend, nearly meet at the base of the cranium, to which they
are attached by a layer of ligamentous and cellular tissue. Each of the
first three branchial arches consists of four pieces movably connected
with one another. The lowest is the <i>hypobranchial</i> (57), the
next much longer one (58) the <i>cerato-branchial</i>, and, above
this, a slender and a short<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span> irregularly-shaped <i>epibranchial</i>
(61). In the fourth arch the hypobranchial is absent. The uppermost
of these segments (62), especially of the fourth arch, are dilated,
and more or less confluent; they are beset with fine teeth, and
generally distinguished as the <i>upper pharyngeal bones</i>. Only the
cerato-branchial is represented in the fifth arch or lower pharyngeal.
On their outer convex side the branchial segments are grooved for the
reception of large blood-vessels and nerves; on the inner side they
support horny processes (63), called the <i>gill-rakers</i>, which do
not form part of the skeleton.</p>

<p>The <i>scapular</i> or <i>humeral arch</i> is suspended from the
skull by the (<i>suprascapula</i>) <i>post-temporal</i> (46), which,
in the Perch, is attached by a triple prong to the occipital and
mastoid bones. Then follows the (<i>scapula</i>) <i>supraclavicula</i>
(47), and the arch is completed below by the union of the large
(<i>coracoid</i>) <i>clavicula</i> (48) with its fellow. Two flat bones
(51, 52), each with a vacuity, attached to the clavicle have been
determined as the (<i>radius</i> and <i>ulna</i>) <i>coracoid</i> and
<i>scapula</i> of higher vertebrates, and the two series of small bones
(53) intervening between the forearm and the fin as <i>carpals</i> and
<i>metacarpals</i>. A two-jointed appendage the (<i>epicoracoid</i>)
<i>postclavicula</i>, is attached to the clavicle: its upper piece (49)
is broad and lamelliform, its lower (50) styliform and pointed.</p>

<p>The ventral fins are articulated to a pair of flat triangular bones,
the <i>pubic</i> bones (80).</p>

<p>The bones of the skull of the fish have received so many different
interpretations that no two accounts agree in their nomenclature,
so that their study is a matter of considerable difficulty to the
beginner. The following synonymic table will tend to overcome
difficulties arising from this cause; it contains the terms used
by Cuvier, those introduced by Owen, and finally the nomenclature
of Stannius, Huxley, and Parker. Those adopted in the present work
are printed in italics. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span> numbers refer to the figures in the
accompanying woodcuts (Figs. <a href="#fig23">23–27</a>).</p>

<span class="subhed">MODIFICATIONS OF THE SKELETON.</span></h2></div>

<p>The lowermost sub-class of fishes, which comprises one form
only, the Lancelet (<i>Branchiostoma</i> [s. <i>Amphioxus</i>]
<i>lanceolatum</i>), possesses the skeleton of the most primitive type.</p>

  </div>

<p>The vertebral column is represented by a simple <i>chorda</i>
<i>dorsalis</i> or <i>notochord</i> only, which extends from one
extremity of the fish to the other, and, so far from being expanded
into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span> a cranial cavity, it is pointed at its anterior end as well as
at its posterior. It is enveloped in a simple membrane like the spinal
chord and the abdominal organs, and there is no trace of vertebral
segments or ribs; however, a series of short cartilaginous rods
above the spine evidently represent apophyses. A maxillary or hyoid
apparatus, or elements representing limbs, are entirely absent.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[J. Müller, Ueber den Bau und die Lebenserscheinungen des
<i>Branchiostoma lubricum</i>, in Abhandl. Ak. Wiss. Berlin,
1844.]</p>
</div>

<p>The skeleton of the <i>Cyclostomata</i> (or Marsipobranchii) (Lampreys
and Sea-hags) shows a considerable advance of development. It consists
of a notochord, the anterior pointed end of which is wedged into the
base of a cranial capsule, partly membranous partly cartilaginous. This
skull, therefore, is not movable upon the spinal column. No vertebral
segmentation can be observed in the notochord, but neural arches are
represented by a series of cartilages on each side of the spinal chord.
In <i>Petromyzon</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig30">30</a>) the basis cranii emits two prolongations
on each side: an inferior, extending for some distance along the lower
side of the spinal column, and a lateral, which is ramified into a
skeleton supporting the branchial apparatus. A stylohyal process and a
subocular arch with a palato-pterygoid portion may be distinguished.
The roof of the cranial capsule is membranous in <i>Myxine</i> and in
the larvæ of <i>Petromyzon</i>, but more or less cartilaginous in the
adult <i>Petromyzon</i> and in <i>Bdellostoma</i>. A cartilaginous
capsule on each side of the hinder part of the skull contains the
auditory organ, whilst the olfactory capsule occupies the anterior
upper part of the roof. A broad cartilaginous lamina, starting from
the cranium and overlying part of the snout, has been determined as
representing the ethmo-vomerine elements, whilst the oral organs
are supported by large, very peculiar cartilages (<i>labials</i>),
greatly differing in general configuration and arrangement in the
various Cyclostomes. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span> are three in the Sea-lamprey, of which the
middle one is joined to the palate by an intermediate smaller one; the
foremost is ring-like, tooth-bearing, emitting on each side a styliform
process. The lingual cartilage is large in all Cyclostomes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span></p>

<p>There is no trace of ribs or limbs.</p>

  </div>

<p>The <i>Chondropterygians</i> exhibit a most extraordinary diversity
in the development of their vertebral column; almost every degree
of ossification, from a notochord without a trace of annular
structure to a series of completely ossified vertebræ being found
in this order. Sharks, in which the notochord is persistent, are
the <i>Holocephali</i> (if they be reckoned to this order, and the
genera <i>Notidanus</i> and <i>Echinorhinus</i>). Among the first,
<i>Chimæra monstrosa</i> begins to show traces of segmentation; but
they are limited to the outer sheath of the notochord, in which slender
subossified rings appear. In <i>Notidanus</i> membranous septa, with a
central vacuity, cross the substance of the gelatinous notochord. In
the other Sharks the segmentation is complete, each vertebra having
a deep conical excavation in front and behind, with a central canal
through which the notochord is continued; but the degree in which the
primitive cartilage is replaced by concentric<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span> or radiating lamellæ of
bone varies greatly in the various genera, and according to the age of
the individuals. In the Rays all the vertebræ are completely ossified,
and the anterior ones confluent into one continuous mass.</p>

<p>In the majority of Chondropterygians the extremity of the vertebral
column shows a decidedly heterocercal condition (Fig. <a href="#fig31">31</a>), and only a
few, like <i>Squatina</i> and some Rays, possess a diphycercal tail</p>

<p>The advance in the development of the skeleton of the Chondropterygians
beyond the primitive condition of the previous sub-classes, manifests
itself further by the presence of neural and hæmal elements, which
extend to the foremost part of the axial column, but of which the hæmal
form a closed arch in the caudal region only, whilst on the trunk they
appear merely as a lateral longitudinal ridge.</p>

  </div>

<p>The neural and hæmal apophyses are either merely attached to the
axis, as in Chondropterygians with persistent notochord, the Rays
and some Sharks; or their basal portions penetrate like wedges into
the substance of the centrum, so that, in a transverse section,
in consequence of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span> the difference in their texture, they appear
in the form of an X.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The interspaces between the neurapophyses
of the vertebræ are not filled by fibrous membrane, as in other
fishes, but by separate cartilages, <i>laminæ</i> or <i>cartilagines
intercrurales</i>, to which frequently a series of terminal pieces
is superadded, which must be regarded as the first appearance of the
interneural spines of the Teleostei and many Ganoids. Similar terminal
pieces are sometimes observed on the hæmal arches. <i>Ribs</i> are
either absent or but imperfectly represented (<i>Carcharias</i>).</p>

<p>The substance of the <i>skull</i> of the Chondropterygians is
cartilage, interrupted especially on its upper surface by more or less
extensive fibro-membranous fontanelles. Superficially it is covered by
a more or less thick chagreen-like osseous deposit. The articulation
with the vertebral column is effected by a pair of lateral condyles. In
the Sharks, besides, a central conical excavation corresponds to that
of the centrum of the foremost vertebral segment, whilst in the Rays
this central excavation of the skull receives a condyle of the axis of
the spinous column.</p>

<p>The cranium itself is a continuous undivided cartilage, in which the
limits of the orbit are well marked by an anterior and posterior
protuberance. The ethmoidal region sends horizontal plates over
the nasal sacs, the apertures of which retain their embryonic
situation upon the under surface of the skull. In the majority of
Chondropterygians these plates are conically produced, forming the base
of the soft projecting snout; and in some forms, especially in the
long-snouted Rays and the Saw-fishes (<i>Pristis</i>) this prolongation
appears in the form of three or more tubiform rods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span></p>

<p>As separate cartilages there are appended to the skull a suspensorium,
a palatine, mandible, hyoid, and rudimentary maxillary elements.</p>

<p>The suspensorium is movably attached to the side of the skull. It
generally consists of one piece only, but in some Rays of two. In the
Rays it is articulated with the mandible only, their hyoid possessing
a distinct point of attachment to the skull. In the Sharks the hyoid
is suspended from the lower end of the suspensorium together with the
mandible.</p>

<p>What is generally called the upper jaw of a Shark is, as Cuvier has
already stated, not the maxillary, but palatine. It consists of two
simple lateral halves, each of which articulates with the corresponding
half of the lower jaw, which is formed by the simple representative of
Meckel’s cartilage.</p>

<p>Some cartilages of various sizes are generally developed on each side
of the palatine, and one on each side of the mandible. They are called
<i>labial</i> cartilages, and seem to represent maxillary elements.</p>

<p>The <i>hyoid</i> consists generally of a pair of long and strong
lateral pieces, and a single mesial piece. From the former
cartilaginous filaments (representing branchiostegals) pass directly
outwards. Branchial arches, varying in number, and similar to the
hyoid, succeed it. They are suspended from the side of the foremost
part of the spinous column, and, like the hyoid, bear a number of
filaments.</p>

<p>The vertical fins are supported by interneural and interhæmal
cartilages, each of which consists of two and more pieces, and to which
the fin-rays are attached without articulation.</p>

<p>The <i>scapular arch</i> of the Sharks is formed by a single coracoid
cartilage bent from the dorsal region downwards and forwards. In
some genera (<i>Scyllium</i>, <i>Squatina</i>) a small separate
scapular cartilage is attached to the dorsal extremities of the
coracoid; but in none of the Elasmobranchs is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span> scapular arch
suspended from the skull or vertebral column; it is merely sunk,
and fixed in the substance of the muscles. Behind, at the point of
its greatest curvature, three carpal cartilages are joined to the
coracoid, which Gegenbaur has distinguished as <i>propterygium</i>,
<i>mesopterygium</i>, and <i>metapterygium</i>, the former occupying
the front, the latter the hind margin of the fin. Several more or
less regular transverse series of styliform cartilages follow. They
represent the phalanges, to which the horny filaments which are
imbedded in the skin of the fin are attached.</p>

<p>In the Rays, with the exception of <i>Torpedo</i>, the scapular arch
is intimately connected with the confluent anterior portion of the
vertebral column. The anterior and posterior carpal cartilages are
followed by a series of similar pieces, which extend like an arch
forwards to the rostral portion of the skull, and backwards to the
pubic region. Extremely numerous phalangeal elements, longest in the
middle, are supported by the carpals, and form the skeleton of the
lateral expansion of the so-called <i>disk</i> of the Ray’s body, which
thus, in fact, is nothing but the enormously enlarged pectoral fin.</p>

<p>The <i>pubic</i> is represented by a single median transverse
cartilage, with which a tarsal cartilage articulates. The latter
supports the fin-rays. To the end of this cartilage is also attached,
in the male Chondropterygians, a peculiar accessory generative organ or
clasper.</p>

<p>The <i>Holocephali</i> differ from the other Chondropterygians in
several important points of the structure of their skeleton, and
approach unmistakably certain Ganoids. That their spinal column is
persistently notochordal has been mentioned already. Their palatal
apparatus, with the suspensorium, coalesces with the skull, the
mandible articulating with a short apophysis of the cranial cartilage.
The mandible is simple, without anterior symphysis. The spine with
which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span> the dorsal fin is armed articulates with a neural apophysis, and
is not immovably attached to it, as in the Sharks. The pubic consists
of two lateral halves, with a short, rounded, tarsal cartilage.</p>

<p>The skeleton of the <i>Ganoid</i> Fishes offers extreme variations with
regard to the degree in which ossifications replace the primordial
cartilage. Whilst some exhibit scarcely any advance beyond the
Plagiostomes with persistent cartilage, others approach, as regards the
development and specialisation of the several parts of their osseous
framework, the Teleosteans so closely that their Ganoid nature can
be demonstrated by, or inferred from, other considerations only. All
Ganoids possess a separate gill-cover.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>The diversity in the development of the Ganoid skeleton is well
exemplified by the few representatives of the order in the existing
Fish-fauna. Lowest in the scale (in this respect) are those with a
persistent notochord, and an <i>autostylic</i> skull, that is, a
skull without separate suspensorium—the fishes constituting the
suborder <i>Dipnoi</i>, of which the existing representatives are
<i>Lepidosiren</i>, <i>Protopterus</i>, and <i>Ceratodus</i>, and
the extinct (as far as demonstrated at present) <i>Dipterus</i>,
<i>Chirodus</i> (and <i>Phaneropleuron</i>?). In these fishes the
notochord is persistent, passing uninterruptedly into the cartilaginous
base of the skull. Only now and then a distinct vertical segmentation
occurs in the caudal portion of the column, but it does not extend
to the notochord itself, but indicates only the limits between the
superadded apophyseal elements, each neural being confluent with the
opposite hæmal. Some <i>Dipnoi</i> are diphy-, others heterocercal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span></p>

<p>Neural and hæmal elements and ribs are well developed. In
<i>Ceratodus</i> each neurapophysis consists of a basal cartilaginous
portion, forming an arch over the myelon, and of a superadded second
portion. The latter is separated from the former by a distinct line of
demarcation, and its two branches are more styliform, cartilaginous
at the ends and in the centre, but with an osseous sheath, and
coalesced at the top, forming a gable over an elastic fibrous band
which runs along and parallel to the longitudinal axis of the column
(<i>Ligamentum longitudinale superius</i>). To the top of this gable
is joined a single long cylindrical neural spine. From the eleventh
apophyseal segment a distinct interneural spine, of the same structure
as the neural, begins to be developed, and farther on a second
interneural is superadded. Towards the extremity of the column these
various pieces are gradually reduced in size and number, finally
only a low cartilaginous band (the rudiments of the neurapophysis)
remaining. The <i>hæmapophyses</i> are in form, size, and structure,
very similar to the neurapophyses; and all these long bones, including
the ribs, have that in common, that they consist of a solid rod of
cartilage enclosed in a bony sheath, which, after the disappearance or
decomposition of the cartilage, appears as a hollow tube. Such bones
are extremely common throughout the order of Ganoids, and their remains
have led to the designation of a family as <i>Cœlacanthi</i> (κοιλος,
hollow; and ἀκανθος, spine).</p>

<p>The primordial <i>cranium</i> of the <i>Dipnoi</i> is cartilaginous,
but with more or less extensive ossifications in its occipital,
basal, or lateral portions, and with large tegumentary bones, the
arrangement of which varies in the different genera. There is no
separate suspensorium for the lower jaw. A strong process descends from
the cranial cartilage, and offers by means of a double condyle (Fig.
<a href="#fig35">35</a> <i>s</i>) attachment to corresponding articulary surfaces of the
lower jaw.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span> Maxillary and intermaxillary elements are not developed,
but, perhaps, represented in <i>Ceratodus</i> by some inconstant
rudimentary labial cartilages situated behind the posterior nasal
opening. Facial cartilages and an infraorbital ring are developed
at least in <i>Ceratodus</i>. The presence of a pair of small teeth
in front indicates the vomerine portion (<i>v</i>) which remains
cartilage, whilst the posterior pair of teeth are implanted in a
pterygo-palatine ossification (<i>l</i>), which sometimes is paired,
sometimes continuous. The base of the skull is constantly covered by a
large basal ossification (<i>o</i>).</p>

<p>The <i>hyoid</i> is well developed, sometimes reduced to a pair of
ceratohyals, sometimes with a basihyal and glossyhyal. The skeleton of
the <i>branchial apparatus</i> approaches the Teleosteous type, less so
in <i>Lepidosiren</i> than in <i>Ceratodus</i>, in which five branchial
arches are developed, but with the lateral and mesial pieces reduced in
number.</p>

<p>A large operculum, and a smaller sub- or interoperculum are present.</p>

<p>The <i>scapular</i> arch consists of a single median transverse
cartilage, and a pair of lateral cartilages which bear the articular
condyle for the pectoral limb. The latter cartilages form the base of a
large membrane-bone, and the whole arch is suspended from the skull by
means of an osseous supraclavicle.</p>

<p>The fore-limb of the <i>Dipnoi</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig36">36</a>) differs externally greatly
from the pectoral fin of other Ganoid fishes. It is covered with
small scales along the middle, from the root<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span> to its extremity, and
surrounded by a rayed fringe similar to the vertical fin. A muscle
split into numerous fascicles extends all the length of the fin, which
is flexible in every part and in every direction. The cartilaginous
framework supporting it is joined to the scapular arch by an oblong
cartilage, followed by a broad basal cartilage (<i>a</i>), generally
single, sometimes showing traces of a triple division. Along the
middle of the fin runs a jointed axis (<i>b</i>), the joints gradually
becoming smaller and thinner towards the extremity; each joint bears
on each side a three, two, or one-jointed branch (<i>c, d</i>). This
<i>axial</i> arrangement of the pectoral skeleton, which evidently
represents one of its first and lowest conditions, has been termed
<i>Archipterygium</i> by Gegenbaur. It is found in <i>Ceratodus</i> and
other genera, but in <i>Lepidosiren</i> the jointed axis only has been
preserved, with the addition of rudimentary rays in <i>Protopterus</i>.</p>

  </div>

<p>The <i>pubic</i> consists of a single flattened subquadrangular
cartilage, produced into a long single anterior process. Posteriorly it
terminates on each side in a condyle, to which the basal cartilage of
the ventral paddle is joined. The endoskeleton of the paddle is almost
identical with that of the pectoral.</p>

<p>The Ganoid fishes with persistent notochord, but with a
<i>hyostylic</i> skull (that is, a skull with a separate
suspensorium) consist of the suborder <i>Chondrostei</i>, of which
the existing representatives are the Sturgeons (<i>Acipenser</i>,
<i>Scaphirhynchus</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span> <i>Polyodon</i>), and the extinct the
<i>Chondrosteidæ</i>, <i>Palæoniscidæ</i>, and (according to Traquair)
<i>Platysomidæ</i>.</p>

<p>Their spinal column does not differ essentially from that of the
Dipnoi. Segmentation is represented only as far as the neural and
hæmal elements are concerned. All are eminently heterocercal. Ribs are
present in most, but replaced by ligaments in <i>Polyodon</i>.</p>

  </div>

<p>The primordial cranium of the Sturgeons consists of persistent
cartilage without ossifications in its substance, but superficial bones
are still more developed and specialised than in the Dipnoi; so it
is, at least, in the true Sturgeons, but less so in <i>Polyodon</i>
(Fig. <a href="#fig37">37</a>). The upper and lateral parts of the skull are covered by
well-developed <i>membrane bones</i>, which, from this suborder,
upwards in the series, will be found to exist throughout the remaining
forms of fishes. They are bones, the origin of which is not in
cartilage but in membranous connective tissue. The lower surface of
the skull is covered by an extremely large basal bone, which extends
from the vomerine region on to the anterior part of the spinal column.
The nasal excavation in the skull is rather lateral than inferior. The
ethmoidal region is generally much produced, forming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span> the base of the
long projecting snout. The suspensorium is movably attached to the
side of the skull, and consists of two pieces, a hyomandibular and a
symplectic, which now appears for the first time as a separate piece,
and to which the hyoid is attached. The palato-maxillary apparatus is
more complex than in the Sharks and Dipnoi; a palato-pterygoid consists
of two mesially-connected rami in <i>Polyodon</i>, and of a complex
cartilaginous disk in <i>Acipenser</i>, being articulated in both to
the Meckelian cartilage. In addition, the Sturgeons possess one or two
pairs of osseous rods, which, in <i>Polyodon</i> at least, represent
the maxillary, and therefore must be the representatives of the labial
cartilages of the Sharks. The Meckelian cartilage is more or less
covered by tegumentary bones.</p>

<p>In the gill-cover, besides the operculum, a sub- and interoperculum may
be distinguished in <i>Acipenser.</i></p>

<p>The hyoid consists of three pieces, of which the posterior bears a
broad branchiostegal in <i>Polyodon.</i></p>

<p>In the scapulary arch the primordial cartilaginous elements scarcely
differ from those of the <i>Dipnoi.</i> The membrane-bones are much
expanded, and offer a continuous series suspended from the skull. Their
division in the median ventral line is complete.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="fig38" style="max-width: 207px">

     <p class="p0 center smaller">Fig. 38.—Fore-limb of Acipenser.</p>
  </div>

<p>The pectoral is supported by a cartilaginous framework (Fig. <a href="#fig38">38</a>)
similar to that of <i>Ceratodus</i>, but much more shortened and
reduced in its periphery, the branches being absent altogether on one
side of the axis. This modification of the fin is analogous to the
heterocercal condition of the end of the spinous column. To the inner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
corner of a basal cartilage (<i>a</i>) a short axis (<i>b</i>) is
joined, which on its outer side bears a few branches (<i>d</i>) only,
the remaining branches (<i>c</i>) being fixed to the basal cartilage.
The dermal fin-rays are opposed to the extremities of the branches, as
in the <i>Dipnoi</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>pubic</i> consists of a paired cartilage, to which tarsal pieces
supporting the fin-rays are attached.</p>

<p>The other living Ganoid fishes have the spinous column entirely or
nearly entirely ossified, and have been comprised under the common name
<i>Holostei</i>. However, they form three very distinct types; several
attempts have been made to coordinate with them the fossil forms, but
this task is beset with extreme difficulties, and its solution hitherto
has not proved to be satisfactory.</p>

<p>The <i>Polypteroidei</i> have their spinous column formed by distinct
osseous <i>amphicœlous</i> vertebræ, that is, vertebræ with concave
anterior and posterior surfaces. It is nearly diphycercal; a slight
degree of heterocercy obtains, inasmuch as the last vertebra is
succeeded by a very thin cartilaginous filament which penetrates
between the halves of one of the middle rays of the terminal fin.
The rays above this cartilaginous filament are articulated to
interneurals, those below lack interhæmals, and are attached either to
the hæmals or vertebral centres. The neural arches, though ossified,
do not coalesce with the centrum, and form one canal only, for the
myelon. There are no intermediate elements between the neural spines.
Interneurals developed, but simple, articulating with the dermoneurals.
The abdominal vertebræ have parapophyses developed with epipleural
spines. Only the caudal vertebræ have hæmal spines, which, like the
interhæmals, agree in every essential respect with the opposite
neurals. <i>Ribs</i> are inserted, not on the parapophyses, but on the
centre, immediately below the parapophyses.</p>

<p>The <i>skull</i> of <i>Polypterus</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig39">39</a>) shows a great advance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
towards the Teleosteous type, the number of separable bones<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span> being
greatly increased. They are arranged much in the same fashion as in
Teleostei. But a great portion of the primordial cranium remains
cartilaginous. The membrane-bones which cover the upper and lower
surfaces of the brain-case are so much developed as to cause the
underlying cartilage to disappear, so that a large vacuity or
fontanelle exists in the substance of the upper as well as lower
cartilaginous wall. Of ossifications belonging to the primordial skull
must be noticed the single occipital with a mastoid on each side.
They are separated by persistent cartilage from the sphenoids and
postfrontals; the former, which are the largest ossification of the
primordial cranium, enclose the anterior half of the brain cavity.
Finally, the nasal portion contains a median ethmoid and a pair of
præfrontal bones.</p>

<p>Only a very small portion of the bones described are visible
externally, nearly the whole of the primordial cranium being covered
by the membrane-bones. Of these are seen on the upper surface a pair
of parietals, frontals, “nasals,” and turbinals; on the lower surface
a large cross-shaped basal, anteriorly bordered on each side by a
pterygoid, parallel to a palatine which forms a suture with the double
vomer. The suspensorium has in front a metapterygoid and quadrate bone,
and an operculum and sub-operculum are attached to it behind.</p>

<p>Præmaxillaries and maxillaries are now fully developed, but immovably
attached to the skull. The lower jaw is ossified, and consists of an
articulary, angular, dentary, and splenial. Of labial cartilages a
rudiment at the angle of the mouth has remained persistent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span></p>

<p>The side of the skull, in front of the operculum, is covered by a large
irregularly-shaped bone (<i>T</i>) (corresponding to the “tympanic
lamina” of <i>Ceratodus</i>, Fig. <a href="#fig35">35</a>, <i>q</i>), held by some to be
the præoperculum; along its upper circumference lies a series of small
ossicles, of which two may be distinguished as spiraculars, as they
form a valve for the protection of the spiracular orifice of these
fishes. An infraorbital ring is represented by a præ- and post-orbital
only.</p>

<p>Each <i>hyoid</i> consists of three pieces, none of which bear
branchiostegals, the single median piece being osseous in front and
cartilaginous behind. Four branchial arches are developed, the foremost
consisting of three, the second and third of two, and the last of a
single piece. There is no lower pharyngeal. Between the rami of the
lower jaw the throat is protected by a pair of large osseous laminæ
(<i>gular plates</i>), which have been considered to represent the
urohyal of osseous fishes.</p>

<p>The scapulary arch is almost entirely formed by the well-developed
membrane-bones, which in the ventral line are suturally united.
The pectoral fin is supported by three bones, pro-, meso-, and
metapterygium, of which the dilated middle one alone bears rays, and is
excluded from the articulation with the shoulder-girdle.</p>

<p>The pubic consists of paired bone, to which tarsal bones supporting the
fin-rays are attached.</p>

<p>In the <i>Lepidosteoidei</i> the vertebræ are completely ossified,
and <i>opisthocœlous</i>, having a convexity in front and a concavity
behind, as in some Amphibians. Though the end of the body externally
appears nearly diphycercal, the termination of the vertebral column
is, in fact, distinctly heterocercal (Fig. <a href="#fig40">40</a>). Its extremity remains
cartilaginous, is turned upwards, and lies immediately below the scutes
which cover the upper margin of the caudal fin. It is preceded by a
few rudimentary vertebræ which gradually pass into the fully developed
normal vertebræ. The caudal fin is suspended from hæmapophyses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span> only,
and does not extend to the neural side of the vertebral column. The
neural arches coalesce with the centrum; interneurals simple. The
abdominal vertebræ have parapophyses, to which the ribs are attached.
Only the caudal vertebræ have hæmal spines.</p>

  </div>

<p>In the skull of <i>Lepidosteus</i> the cartilage of the endocranium is
still more replaced by ossifications than in <i>Polypterus</i>; those
ossifications, moreover, being represented by a greater number of
discrete bones; especially the membrane-bones are greatly multiplied:
the occipital, for instance, consists of three pieces; the vomer is
double as in <i>Polypterus</i>; the maxillary consists of a series of
pieces firmly united by suture. The symplectic reaches the lower jaw,
so that the articulary is provided with a double joint, viz. for the
symplectic and quadrate; the component parts of the lower jaw are as
numerous as in reptiles, a dentary, splenial, articulary, angular,
supra-angular, and coronary being distinct. The sides of the head
are covered with numerous bones, and a præoperculum is developed in
front of the gill-cover which, again, consists of an operculum and
sub-operculum.</p>

<p>Each hyoid consists of three pieces, of which the middle is the
longest, the upper bearing the largest of the three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span> branchiostegals
which <i>Lepidosteus</i> possesses; a long and large glossohyal is
intercalated between the lower ends of the hyoids. There are five
branchial arches, the hindmost of which is modified into a lower
pharyngeal; upper pharyngeals are likewise present as in the majority
of Teleosteous fishes. No gular plate.</p>

<p>Of the scapulary arch the two halves are separated by a suture in the
median line; the membrane-bones are well developed, only a remnant of
the primordial cartilage remaining; the supraclavicle is very similar
to that of Teleosteous fishes, less so the post-temporal. The base to
which the limb is attached is a single osseous plate, supporting on its
posterior margin semi-ossified rods in small number, which bear the
pectoral rays.</p>

<p>The pubic consists of paired bone, the anterior ends of which overlap
each other, the extremity of the right pubis being dorsad to that of
the left. The elements representing a tarsus are quite rudimentary and
reduced in number (two or three).</p>

<p>The vertebral column of the <i>Amioidei</i> shows unmistakable
characters of the Palæichthyic type. The arrangement of its component
parts is extremely simple. The centra of the amphicœlous vertebræ are
well ossified, but the neural and hæmal arches do not coalesce with the
centra, from which they are separated by a thin layer of cartilage.
Singularly, not every vertebra has apophyses: in the caudal portion of
<i>Amia</i> the vertebræ are alternately provided with them and lack
them. The heterocercal condition of the spinous column is well marked:
as in the other Holostei the hindmost vertebræ are turned upwards,
become smaller and smaller in size, and lose their neural arches, the
hæmals remaining developed to the end. Finally, the column terminates
in a thin cartilaginous band, which is received between the lateral
halves of the fifth or sixth upper caudal ray. Interneurals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span> and
interhæmals simple. Only the abdominal vertebræ have parapophyses, with
which the ribs are articulated.</p>

<p>The configuration of the skull, and the development and arrangement
of its component parts, approaches so much the Teleosteous type
that, perhaps, there are greater differences in skulls of truly
Teleosteous fishes than between the skulls of <i>Amia</i> and many
<i>Physostomi</i>. Externally the cranium is entirely ossified; and
the remains of the cartilaginous primordial cranium (which, however,
has no vacuity in its roof) can only be seen in a section, and are
of much less extent than in many Physostomous fishes. The immovable
intermaxillary, the double vomer, the plurality of ossifications
representing the articulary, the double articulary cavity of the
mandible for junction with the quadrate and symplectic bones, remind
us still of similar conditions in the skull of <i>Lepidosteus</i>, but
the mobility and formation of the maxillary, the arrangement of the
gill-covers, the development of the opercles, the suspensorium, the
palate, the insertion of a number of branchiostegals on the long middle
hyoid piece, the composition of the branchial framework (with upper
and lower pharyngeals), are as in the Teleosteous type. A gular plate
replaces the urohyal.</p>

<p>The scapular arch is composed entirely of the membrane-bones found in
the <i>Teleostei</i>, and the two sides are loosely united by ligament.
The base to which the limb is attached is cartilaginous; short
semi-ossified rods are arranged along its hinder margin and bear the
pectoral rays.</p>

<p>The skeleton of the hind-limb agrees entirely with that of
<i>Lepidosteus</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[T. W. Bridge, The Cranial Osteology of <i>Amia calva</i>; in
Journ. Anat. and Physiol. vol. xi.]</p>
</div>

<p>In the <i>Teleosteous</i> fishes the spinous column consists of
completely ossified amphicœlous vertebræ; its termination is
<i>homocercal</i>—that is, the caudal fin appears to be more or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span> less
symmetrical, the last vertebra occupying a central position in the
base of the fin, and being coalesced with a flat osseous lamella, the
<i>hypural</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig23">23</a>, <a href="#fig70">70</a>), on the hind margin of which the fin-rays
are fixed. The hypural is but a union of modified hæmapophyses which
are directed backwards, and the actual termination of the notochord
is bent upwards, and lies along the upper edge of the hypural, hidden
below the last rudimentary neural elements. In some Teleosteans, as the
<i>Salmonidæ</i>, the last vertebræ are conspicuously bent upwards: in
fact, strictly speaking, this homocercal condition is but one of the
various degrees of heterocercy, different from that of many Ganoids
in this respect only, that the caudal fin itself has assumed a higher
degree of symmetry.</p>

<p>The neural and hæmal arches generally coalesce with the centrum, but
there are many exceptions, inasmuch as some portion of the arches of a
species, or all of them, show the original division.</p>

<p>The vertebræ are generally united with one another by zygapophyses, and
frequently similar additional articulations exist at the lower parts
of the centra. Parapophyses and ribs are very general, but the latter
are inserted on the centra and the base of the processes, and never on
their extremities. The point of insertion of the rib, more especially
on the anterior vertebræ, may be still higher—viz. at the base of the
neural arch, as in <i>Cotylis</i> and allied genera, and even on the
top of the neurapophysis, as in <i>Batrachus</i>.</p>

<p>There is a great amount of variation as regards the degree in which
the primordial cranium persists; it is always more or less replaced
by bone; frequently it disappears entirely, but in some fishes, like
the <i>Salmonidæ</i> or <i>Esocidæ</i>, the cartilage persists to
the same or even to a greater extent than in the Ganoidei holostei.
Added to the bones preformed in cartilage are a great number of
<i>membrane-bones</i>. The different kinds of these membrane-bones
occur with greater or less<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span> constancy throughout this sub-class;
they often coalesce with, and are no more separable from, the
neighbouring or underlying cartilage-bones. All these bones have been
topographically enumerated in Chapter IV.</p>

<p>Many attempts have been made to classify the bones of the Teleosteous
skull, according to their supposed relation to each other, or with
the view to demonstrate the unity of plan on which the skull has been
built; but in all either the one or the other of the following two
principles has been followed:—</p>

<p>A. The “vertebral doctrine” starts from the undeniable fact that the
skull is originally composed of several segments, each of which is
merely the modification of a vertebra. The component parts of such a
cranial segment are considered to be homologous to those of a vertebra.
Three, four, or five cranial vertebræ have been distinguished, all
the various bones of the fully-developed and ossified skull being
referred, without distinction as to their origin, to one or the other
of those vertebral segments. The idea of the typical unity of the
osseous framework of Vertebrates has been worked out with the greatest
originality and knowledge of detail, by <i>Owen</i>, who demonstrates
that the fish-skull is composed of <i>four</i> vertebræ.</p>

<p>The bones of the fish-skull are, according to him, primarily divisible
into those of the <i>neuroskeleton</i>, <i>splanchnoskeleton</i>, and
<i>dermoskeleton</i>.</p>

<p>The bones of the <i>neuro</i>- or proper <i>endoskeleton</i> are
arranged in a series of four horizontally succeeding segments: the
occipital, parietal, frontal, and nasal vertebræ; each segment
consisting of an upper (neural) and a lower (hæmal) arch, with a common
centre, and with diverging appendages.</p>

<p>The <i>neural</i> arches of the four vertebræ, in their succession from
the occiput towards the snout, are:—</p>

<p>1. <i>Epencephalic arch</i>, composed of the occipitals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span></p>

<p>2. <i>Mesencephalic arch</i>, composed of basisphenoid, alisphenoid,
parietal, and mastoid.</p>

<p>3. <i>Prosencephalic arch</i>, composed of presphenoid,
orbito-sphenoid, frontal, and postfrontal.</p>

<p>4. <i>Rhinencephalic arch</i>, composed of vomer, prefrontal, and nasal.</p>

<p>The <i>hæmal</i> arches in the same order of succession are:—</p>

<p>1. <i>Scapular</i> or <i>scapulo-coracoid</i> arch, composed of
suprascapula, scapula, and coracoid; its appendage consists of the
ulna, radius and carpal.</p>

<p>2. <i>Hyoid</i> or <i>stylo-hyoid</i> arch, composed of stylohyal,
epihyal, ceratohyal, basihyal, glossohyal, and urohyal; its appendage
is the branchiostegals.</p>

<p>3. <i>Mandibular</i> or <i>tympano-mandibular</i> arch, composed of
epi-, meso-, pre-, and hypo-tympanic, and the bones of the lower jaw;
its appendage consists of the præoperculum and the other opercles.</p>

<p>4. <i>Maxillary</i> or <i>palato-maxillary</i> arch, composed of
palatine, maxillary, and premaxillary; its appendage consists of the
pterygoid and entopterygoid.</p>

<p>Parts of the <i>splanchnoskeleton</i> are held to be the ear-capsule
or petrosal and the otolite, the eye-capsule or sclerotic, the
nose-capsule or “ethmoid” and turbinal; the branchial arches.</p>

<p>The bones of the <i>dermoskeleton</i> are the supratemporals,
supraorbitals, suborbitals, and labials.</p>

<p>B. In the second method of classifying the bones of the skull
prominence is given to the facts of their different origin as
ascertained by a study of their development. The parts developed from
the primordial skull, or the cartilaginous case protecting the nervous
centre are distinguished from those which enclose and support the
commencement of the alimentary canal and the respiratory apparatus, and
which, consisting of several arches, are comprised under the common
name of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span> <i>visceral skeleton of the skull</i>. Further, a distinction
is made between the bones preformed in cartilage and those originating
in tegumentary or membranous tissue. It is admitted that the primordial
cranium is a coalition of several segments, the number of which is
determined by that of the visceral arches, these representing the hæmal
arches of the vertebral column; but the membrane-bones are excluded
from a consideration of the vertebral division of the primordial skull,
as elements originally independent of it, although these additions have
entered into special relations to the cartilage-bones.</p>

<p>With these views the bones of the Teleosteous skull are classified
thus:—</p>

<p>1. <i>Cartilage-bones of the primordial skull</i>.—The
<i>basi-occipital</i> (5 in Figs. <a href="#fig23">23–26</a>) has retained the form of
a vertebral centrum; it is generally concave behind, the concavity
containing remains of the notochord; rarely a rounded articulary
head of the first vertebra fits into it, as in <i>Symbranchus</i>,
and still more rarely it is provided with such an articulary head
(<i>Fistularia</i>); frequently it shows two excavations on its
inner surface for the reception of the <i>saccus vestibuli</i>.
The <i>exoccipitals</i> (10) are situated on the side of the
basi-occipital, and contribute the greater portion of the periphery of
the foramen magnum; frequently they articulate with the first vertebra,
or meet in the upper median line, so as to exclude the supraoccipital
from the foramen magnum. The <i>supraoccipital</i> (8) is intercalated
between the exoccipitals, and forms a most prominent part by the median
crest, which sometimes extends far forwards on the upper side of the
skull, and offers attachment to the dorsal portion of the large lateral
muscle of the trunk. When the interior portions of this bone remain
cartilaginous, some part of the semicircular canals may be lodged in it.</p>

<p>The region of the skull which succeeds the bones described encloses at
least the greater portion of the labyrinth, and its component parts
have been named with reference to it by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span> some anatomists.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> The
<i>alisphenoids</i> (11) (<i>Prooticum</i>) form sutures posteriorly
with the basi- and exoccipitals, and meet each other in the median line
at the bottom of the cerebral cavity; they contribute to the formation
of a hollow in which the hypophysis cerebri and the saccus vasculosus
are received; in conjunction with the exoccipital it forms another
hollow for the reception of the vestibulum; generally it is perforated
by the Trigeminal and Facial nerves. The <i>paroccipitals</i>
(9) (<i>Epioticum</i>) lodge a portion of the posterior vertical
semicircular canal, and form a projection of the skull on each side
of the occipital crest, to which a terminal branch of the scapular
arch is attached. The <i>Mastoid</i> (12 + 13) (<i>Opisthoticum</i>)
occupies the postero-external projection of the head; it encloses a
part of the external semicircular canal; is generally coalesced with a
membrane-bone, the superficial <i>squamosal</i>, which emits a process
for the suspension of the scapular arch, and is frequently, as in the
Perch, divided into two separate bones.</p>

<p>The anterior portion of the skull varies greatly as regards form, which
is chiefly dependent on the extent of the cerebral cavity; if the
latter is advanced far forwards, the lateral walls of the primordial
cranium are protected by more developed ossifications than if the
cerebral cavity is shortened by the presence of a wide and deep orbit.
In the latter case parts which normally form the side of the skull are
situated in front of the brain-case, between it and the orbit, and
generally reduced in extent, often replaced by membranes; especially
the interorbital septum may be reduced to membrane. The most constant
ossifications of this part of the skull are the <i>orbitosphenoids</i>
(14), which join the upper anterior margin of the alisphenoids. They
vary much with regard to their development—they are small in Gadoids;
larger in the Perch, Pike, Salmonoids, Macrodon, and the Clupeoids;
and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span> very large in Cyprinoids and Siluroids, in which they contribute
to the formation of the side of the brain-case. The single Y-shaped
<i>Sphenoideum anterius</i> (15) is as frequently absent as present; it
forms the anterior margin of the fossa for the hypophysis. Finally, the
<i>postfrontal</i> (4) belongs also to this group of cartilage-bones.</p>

<p>The centre of the foremost part of the skull is occupied by the
<i>ethmoid</i> (3), which shows great variations as regards its extent
and the degree of ossification; it may extend backwards into the
interorbital septum, and reach the orbitosphenoids, or may be confined
to the extremity of the skull; it may remain entirely cartilaginous,
or ossify into a lamina which separates the two orbits and encloses
an anterior prolongation of the brain-case, along which the olfactory
nerves pass: modifications occurring again in higher vertebrates. A
paired ossification attached to the fore-part of the ethmoid is the
<i>pre-frontals</i> (2), which form the base of the nasal fossa.</p>

<p>2. <i>Membrane-bones attached to the primordial skull</i>.—To this
group belong the <i>parietals</i> (7) and <i>frontals</i> (1).
The <i>squamosal</i> (12) has been mentioned above in connection
with the mastoid. The <i>supraorbital</i> is always small, and
frequently absent. The lower surface of the skull is protected by the
<i>basisphenoid</i> (parasphenoid) (6) and the <i>vomer</i> (16), both
of which, especially the latter, may be armed with teeth.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>3. <i>Cartilage bones of the alimentary portion of the visceral
skeleton of the skull</i>.—The suspensorium consists of three
cartilage-bones, and affords a base for the opercular apparatus
as well as a point of attachment to the hyoid, whilst in front it
is connected with the palato-pterygo-palatine arch. They are the
<i>hyomandibular</i> (23), <i>symplectic</i> (31), and <i>quadrate</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
(26), connected by means of the <i>metapterygoid</i> (27) with the
<i>ecto-</i> (24) and <i>ento-pterygoid</i> (25), the foremost bone
of the arch being the <i>palatine</i> (22). All these bones have
been sufficiently described above (p. 55), and it remains only to be
mentioned that the bones of the palatine arch are but rarely absent,
as for instance in <i>Murænophis</i>; and that the symplectic does
not extend to the articulary of the mandible, as in <i>Amia</i> and
<i>Lepidosteus</i>, though its suspensory relation to the Meckelian
cartilage is still indicated by a ligament which connects the two
pieces. Of the mandibulary bones the <i>articulary</i> (35) is
distinctly part of Meckel’s cartilage. Frequently another portion of
cartilage below the articulary remains persistent, or is replaced by a
separate membrane-bone, the angular.</p>

<p>4. <i>Membrane-bones of the alimentary portion of the visceral
skeleton of the skull</i>.—The suspensorium has one tegumentary bone
attached to it, viz. the <i>præoperculum</i> (30); it is but rarely
absent, for instance in <i>Murænophis</i>. The <i>premaxillary</i>
(17) and <i>maxillary</i> (18) of the Teleostei appear to be also
membrane-bones, although they are clearly analogous to the upper
labial cartilages of the Sharks. The premaxillaries sometimes coalesce
into a single piece (as in <i>Diodon</i>, <i>Mormyrus</i>), or they
are firmly united with the maxillaries (as in all <i>Gymnodonts</i>,
<i>Serrasalmo</i>, etc.) The relative position and connection of
these two bones differs much, and is a valuable character in the
discrimination of the various families. In some, the front margin of
the jaw is formed by the premaxillary only, the two bones having a
parallel position, as it has been described in the Perch (p. 53); in
others, the premaxillary is shortened, allowing the maxillary to enter,
and to complete, the margin of the upper jaw; and finally, in many no
part of the maxillary is situated behind the premaxillary, but the
entire bone is attached to the end of the premaxillary, forming its
continuation. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span> the last case the maxillary may be quite abortive.
The mobility of the upper jaw is greatest in those fishes in which the
premaxillary alone forms its margin. The form of the premaxillary is
subject to great variation: the beak of <i>Belone</i>, <i>Xiphias</i>
is formed by the prolonged and coalesced premaxillaries. The maxillary
consists sometimes of one piece, sometimes of two or three. The
principal membrane-bone of the mandible is the <i>dentary</i> (34),
to which is added the <i>angular</i> (36) and rarely a smaller one,
the <i>splenial</i> or os <i>operculare</i>, which is situated at the
inside of the articulary.</p>

<p>5. <i>Cartilage-bones of the respiratory portion of the visceral
skeleton of the skull.</i>—With few exceptions all the ossifications
of the hyoid and branchial arches, as described above (p. 58), belong
to this group.</p>

<p>6. <i>Membrane-bones of the respiratory portion of the visceral
skeleton of the skull.</i>—They are the following: the opercular
pieces, viz. <i>operculum</i> (28), <i>sub-operculum</i> (32), and
<i>interoperculum</i> (33). The last of these is the least constant; it
may be entirely absent, and represented by a ligament extending from
the mandible to the hyoid. The <i>urohyal</i> (42) which separates the
musculi sternohyoidei, and serves for an increased surface of their
insertion; and finally the <i>branchiostegals</i> (43), which vary
greatly in number, but are always fixed to the cerato- and epi-hyals.</p>

<p>7. <i>Dermal bones of the skull.</i>—To this category are referred
some bones which are ossifications of, and belong to, the cutis. They
are the <i>turbinals</i> (20), the <i>suborbitals</i> (19), and the
<i>supratemporals</i>. They vary much with regard to the degree in
which they are developed, and are rarely entirely absent. Nearly always
they are wholly or partly transformed into tubes or hollows, in which
the muciferous canals with their numerous nerves are lodged. Those
in the temporal and scapulary regions are not always developed; on
the other hand, the series of those ossicles may be continued on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span> to
the trunk, accompanying the lateral line. In many fishes those of the
infraorbital ring are much dilated, protecting the entire space between
the orbit and the rim of the præoperculum; in others, especially
those which have the angle of the præoperculum armed with a powerful
spine, the infraorbital ring emits a process towards the spine, which
thus serves as a stay or support of this weapon (<i>Scorpænidæ</i>,
<i>Cottidæ</i>).</p>

<p>The <i>pectoral</i> arch of the Teleosteous fishes exhibits but
a remnant of a primordial cartilage, which is replaced by two
ossifications,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> the <i>coracoid</i> (51) and <i>scapula</i> (52);
they offer posteriorly attachment to two series of short rods, of
which the proximal are nearly always ossified, whilst the distal
frequently remain small cartilaginous nodules hidden in the base of
the pectoral rays. The bones, by which this portion is connected with
the skull, are membrane-bones, viz. the <i>clavicle</i> (49), with
the <i>postclavicle</i> (49 + 50), the <i>supraclavicle</i> (47), and
<i>post-temporal</i> (46). The order of their arrangement in the Perch
has been described above (p. 59). However, many Teleosteous fish lack
pectoral fins, and in them the pectoral arch is frequently more or
less reduced or rudimentary, as in many species of <i>Murænidæ</i>.
In others the membrane-bones are exceedingly strong, contributing to
the outer protective armour of the fish, and then the clavicles are
generally suturally connected in the median line. The postclavicula
and the supraclavicula may be absent. Only exceptionally the
shoulder-girdle is not suspended from the skull, but from the anterior
portion of the spinous column (<i>Symbranchidæ</i>, <i>Murænidæ</i>,
<i>Notacanthidæ</i>). The number of basal elements of each of the two
series never exceeds five, but may be less; and the distal series is
absent in Siluroids.</p>

<p>The <i>pubic</i> bones of the Teleosteous fishes undergo many
modifications of form in the various families, but they are essentially
of the same simple type as in the Perch.</p>

<h2 class="smaller">CHAPTER V.<br>
<span class="subhed">MYOLOGY.</span></h2></div>

<p>In the lowest vertebrate, <i>Branchiostoma</i>, the whole of the
<i>muscular</i> mass is arranged in a longitudinal band running along
each side of the body; it is vertically divided into a number of flakes
or segments (<i>myocommas</i>) by aponeurotic septa, which serve as the
surfaces of insertion to the muscular fibres. But this muscular band
has no connection with the notochord except in its foremost portion,
where some relation has been formed to the visceral skeleton. A very
thin muscular layer covers the abdomen.</p>

<p>Also in the <i>Cyclostomes</i> the greatest portion of the muscular
system is without direct relation to the skeleton, and, again, it is
only on the skull and visceral skeleton where distinct muscles have
been differentiated for special functions.</p>

<p>To the development of the skeleton in the more highly organised fishes
corresponds a similar development of the muscles; and the maxillary and
branchial apparatus, the pectoral and ventral fins, the vertical fins,
and especially the caudal, possess a separate system of muscles. But
the most noteworthy is the muscle covering the sides of the trunk and
tail (already noticed in <i>Branchiostoma</i>), which Cuvier described
as the “great lateral muscle,” and which, in the higher fishes, is a
compound of many smaller segments, corresponding in number with the
vertebræ. Each lateral muscle is divided by a median longitudinal
groove into a dorsal and ventral half; the depression in its middle
is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span> filled by an embryonal muscular substance which contains a large
quantity of fat and blood-vessels, and therefore differs from ordinary
muscle by its softer consistency, and by its colour which is reddish
or grayish. Superficially the lateral muscle appears crossed by a
number of white parallel tendinous zig-zag stripes, forming generally
three angles, of which the upper and lower point backwards, the middle
one forwards. These are the outer edges of the aponeurotic septa
between the myocommas. Each septum is attached to the middle and the
apophyses of a vertebra, and, in the abdominal region, to its rib;
frequently the septa receive additional support by the existence of
epipleural spines. The fibres of each myocomma run straight and nearly
horizontally from one septum to the next; they are grouped so as to
form semiconical masses, of which the upper and lower have their apices
turned backwards, whilst the middle cone, formed by the contiguous
parts of the preceding, has its apex directed forward; this fits into
the interspace between the antecedent upper and lower cones, the apices
of which reciprocally enter the depressions in the succeeding segment,
whereby all the segments are firmly locked together (<i>Owen</i>).</p>

<p>In connection with the muscles reference has to be made to the
<i>Electric organs</i> with which certain fishes are provided, as it is
more than probable, not only from the examination of peculiar muscular
organs occurring in the Rays, <i>Mormyrus</i>, and <i>Gymnarchus</i>
(the function of which is still conjectural), but especially from
the researches into the development of the electric organ of
<i>Torpedo</i>, that the electric organs have been developed out of
muscular substance. The fishes possessing fully developed electric
organs, with the power of accumulating electric force and communicating
it in the form of shocks to other animals, are the electric Rays
(<i>Torpedinidæ</i>), the electric Sheath-fish of tropical Africa
(<i>Malapterurus</i>), and the electric Eel of tropical America<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
(<i>Gymnotus</i>). The structure and arrangement of the electric organ
is very different in these fishes, and will be subsequently described
in the special account of the several species.</p>

<p>The phenomena attending the exercise of this extraordinary faculty
also closely resemble muscular action. The time and strength of the
discharge are entirely under the control of the fish. The power is
exhausted after some time, and it needs repose and nourishment to
restore it. If the electric nerves are cut and divided from the brain
the cerebral action is interrupted, and no irritant to the body has any
effect to excite electric discharge; but if their ends be irritated
the discharge takes place, just as a muscle is excited to contraction
under similar circumstances. And, singularly enough, the application
of strychnine causes simultaneously a tetanic state of the muscles and
a rapid succession of involuntary electric discharges. The strength of
the discharges depends entirely on the size, health, and energy of the
fish: an observation entirely agreeing with that made on the efficacy
of snake-poison. Like this latter, the property of the electric force
serves two ends in the economy of the animals which are endowed with
it; it is essential and necessary to them for overpowering, stunning,
or killing the creatures on which they feed, whilst incidentally they
use it as the means of defending themselves from their enemies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span></p>

<h2 class="smaller">CHAPTER VI.<br>
<span class="subhed">NEUROLOGY.</span></h2></div>

<p>The most simple condition of the nervous central organ known in
Vertebrates is found in <i>Branchiostoma</i>. In this fish the spinal
chord tapers at both ends, an anterior cerebral swelling, or anything
approaching a brain, being absent. It is band-like along its middle
third, and groups of darker cells mark the origins of the fifty or
sixty pairs of nerves which accompany the intermuscular septa, and
divide into a dorsal and ventral branch, as in other fishes. The two
anterior pairs pass to the membranous parts above the mouth, and supply
with nerve filaments a ciliated depression near the extremity of the
fish, which is considered to be an olfactory organ, and two pigment
spots, the rudiments of eyes. An auditory organ is absent.</p>

<p>The <i>spinal chord</i> of the <i>Cyclostomes</i> is flattened in its
whole extent, band-like, and elastic; also in <i>Chimæra</i> it is
elastic, but flattened in its posterior portion only. In all other
fishes it is cylindrical, non-ductile, and generally extending along
the whole length of the spinal canal. The Plectognaths offer a singular
exception in this respect that the spinal chord is much shortened, the
posterior portion of the canal being occupied by a long cauda equina;
this shortening of the spinal chord has become extreme in the Sun-fish
(<i>Orthagoriscus</i>), in which it has shrunk into a short and conical
appendage of the brain. Also in the Devil-fish (<i>Lophius</i>) a long
cauda equina partly conceals the chord which terminates on the level of
about the twelfth vertebra.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span></p>

<p>The <i>brain</i> of fishes is relatively small; in the Burbot
(<i>Lota</i>) it has been estimated to be 1/720th part of the weight of
the entire fish, in the Pike the 1/1305th part, and in the large Sharks
it is relatively still smaller. It never fills the entire cavity of
the cranium; between the dura mater which adheres to the inner surface
of the cranial cavity, and the arachnoidea which envelops the brain, a
more or less considerable space remains, which is filled with a soft
gelatinous mass generally containing a large quantity of fat. It has
been observed that this space is much less in young specimens than in
adult, which proves that the brain of fishes does not grow in the same
proportion as the rest of the body; and, indeed, its size is nearly the
same in individuals of which one is double the bulk of the other.</p>

  </div>

<p>The brain of <i>Osseous fishes</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig41">41</a>) viewed from above shows
three protuberances, respectively termed <i>prosencephalon</i>,
<i>mesencephalon</i>, and <i>metencephalon</i>, the two anterior of
which are paired, the hindmost being single. The foremost pair are the
<i>hemispheres</i>, which are solid in their interior, and provided
with two swellings in front, the <i>olfactory lobes</i>. The second
pair are the <i>optic lobes</i>, which generally are larger than
the hemispheres, and succeeded by the third single portion, <i>the
cerebellum</i>. In the fresh state the hemispheres are of a grayish
colour, and often show some shallow depressions on their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span> surface; a
narrow commissure of white colour connects them with each other. The
optic lobes possess a cavity (<i>ventriculus lobioptici</i>), at the
bottom of which some protuberances of variable development represent
the corpora quadrigemina of higher animals. On the lower surface of
the base of the optic lobes, behind the <i>crura cerebri</i>, two
swellings are observed, the <i>lobi inferiores</i>, which slightly
diverge in front for the passage of the <i>infundibulum</i>, from
which a generally large <i>hypophysis</i> or <i>pituitary gland</i> is
suspended. The relative size of the cerebellum varies greatly in the
different osseous fishes: in the Tunny and Silurus it is so large as
nearly to cover the optic lobes; sometimes distinct transverse grooves
and a median longitudinal groove are visible. The cerebellum possesses
in its interior a cavity which communicates with the anterior part of
the fourth ventricle. The <i>medulla oblongata</i> is broader than
the spinal chord, and contains the <i>fourth ventricle</i>, which
forms the continuation of the central canal of the spinal chord. In
most fishes a perfect roof is formed over the fourth ventricle by two
longitudinal pads, which meet each other in the median line (<i>lobi
posteriores</i>), and but rarely it remains open along its upper
surface.</p>

<p>The brain of <i>Ganoid fishes</i> shows great similarity to that of the
Teleostei; however, there is considerable diversity of the arrangement
of its various portions in the different types. In the Sturgeons and
<i>Polypterus</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig42">42</a>) the hemispheres are more or less remote
from the mesencephalon, so that in an upper view the crura cerebri,
with the intermediate entrance into the third ventricle (<i>fissura
cerebri magna</i>), may be seen. A vascular membranous sac, containing
lymphatic fluid (<i>epiphysis</i>), takes its origin from the third
ventricle, its base being expanded over the anterior interspace of the
optic lobes, and the apex being fixed to the cartilaginous roof of the
cranium. This structure is not peculiar to the Ganoids, but found in
various stages of development in Teleosteans, marking,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span> when present,
the boundary between prosencephalon and mesencephalon. The lobi optici
are essentially as in Teleosteans. The cerebellum penetrates into
the ventriculus lobi optici, and extends thence into the open sinus
rhomboidalis. At its upper surface it is crossed by a commissure formed
by the <i>corpora restiformia</i> of the medulla.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="fig42" style="max-width: 750px">

  </div>

<p>As regards external configuration, the brain of <i>Lepidosteus</i>
and <i>Amia</i> approach still more the Teleosteous type. The
prosencephalon, mesencephalon, and metencephalon are contiguous, and
the cerebellum lacks the prominent transverse commissure at its upper
surface. The sinus rhomboidalis is open.</p>

<p>The brain of the <i>Dipnoi</i> shows characters reminding us of that of
the Ganoids as well as the Chondropterygians, <i>Ceratodus</i> agreeing
with <i>Protopterus</i> in this respect, as in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span> most other points of
its organisation. The hemispheres form the largest part of the brain;
they are coalescent, as in Sharks, but possess two lateral ventricles,
the separation being externally indicated by a shallow median groove
on the upper surface. The olfactory lobes take their origin from
the upper anterior end of the hemispheres. Epiphysis and hypophysis
well developed. The lobi optici are very small, and remote from the
prosencephalon, their division into the lateral halves being indicated
by a median groove only. The cerebellum is very small, overlying the
front part of the sinus rhomboidalis.</p>

  </div>

<p>The brain of <i>Chondropterygians</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig43">43</a>) is more developed than
that of all other fishes, and distinguished by well-marked characters.
These are, first, the prolongation of the olfactory lobes into more or
less long pedicles, which dilate into great ganglionic masses, where
they come into contact with the olfactory sacs; secondly, the space
which generally intervenes between prosencephalon and mesencephalon, as
in some Ganoids; thirdly, the large development of the metencephalon.</p>

<p>The hemispheres are generally large, coalescent, but with a median,
longitudinal, dividing groove. Frequently their surface shows traces
of gyrations, and when they are provided with lateral ventricles,
tubercles representing <i>corpora striata</i> may be observed. The
olfactory pedicles take their origin from the side of the hemispheres,
and are frequently hollow, and if so, their cavity communicates with
the ventricle of the hemisphere. The optic lobes are generally smaller
than the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span> hemispheres, coalescent, and provided with an upper median
groove like the prosencephalon. At their base a pair of lobi inferiores
are constant, with the hypophysis and <i>sacsus vasculosus</i> (a
conglomeration of vascular loops without medullary substance) between
them.</p>

<p>The cerebellum is very large, overlying a portion of the optic lobes
and of the sinus rhomboidalis, and is frequently transversely grooved.
The side-walls of the fourth ventricle, which are formed by the corpora
restiformia, are singularly folded, and appear as two pads, one on
each side of the cerebellum (<i>lobi posteriores</i> s. <i>lobi nervi
trigemini</i>).</p>

<p>The brain of the <i>Cyclostomes</i> (Figs. <a href="#fig44">44</a>, <a href="#fig45">45</a>) represents a type
different from that of other fishes, showing at its upper surface
three pairs of protuberances in front of the cerebellum; they are
all solid. Their homologies are not yet satisfactorily determined,
parts of the Myxinoid brain having received by the same observers
determinations very different from those given<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span> to the corresponding
parts of the brain of the Lampreys. The foremost pair are the large
olfactory tubercles, which are exceedingly large in <i>Petromyzon</i>.
They are followed by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span> hemispheres, with a single body wedged in
between their posterior half; in <i>Petromyzon</i>, at least, the
vascular tissue leading to an epiphysis seems to be connected with
this body. Then follows the lobus ventriculi tertii, distinctly
paired in Myxinoids, less so in <i>Petromyzon</i>. The last pair are
the <i>corpora quadrigemina</i>. According to this interpretation
the cerebellum would be absent in Myxinoids, and represented in
<i>Petromyzon</i> by a narrow commissure only (Fig. <a href="#fig45">45</a>, <i>b</i>),
stretching over the foremost part of the sinus rhomboidalis. In the
Myxinoids the <i>medulla oblongata</i> ends in two divergent swellings,
free and obtuse at their extremity, from which most of the cerebral
nerves take their origin.</p>


<p>The <i>Nerves</i> which supply the organs of the head are either merely
continuations or diverticula of the brain-substance, or proper nerves
taking their origin from the brain, or receiving their constituent
parts from the foremost part of the spinal chord. The number of these
spino-cerebral nerves is always less than in the higher vertebrates,
and their arrangement varies considerably.</p>


<p class="center">A. <i>Nerves which are diverticula of the brain</i> (Figs. <a href="#fig41">41–45</a>).</p>

<p>The <i>olfactory</i> nerves (<i>first pair</i>) always retain their
intimate relation to the hemispheres, the ventricles of which are not
rarely continued into the tubercle or even pedicle of the nerves. The
different position of the olfactory tubercle has been already described
as characteristic of some of the orders of fishes. In those fishes
in which the tubercle is remote from the brain, the nerve which has
entered the tubercle as a single stem leaves it split up into several
or numerous branches, which are distributed in the nasal organ. In
the other fishes it breaks up into branchlets spread into a fan-like
expansion at the point, where it enters the nasal cavity. The nerve
always passes out of the skull through the ethmoid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span></p>

<p>The <i>optic</i> nerves (<i>second pair</i>) vary in size, their
strength corresponding to the size of the eye; they take their
origin from the <i>lobi optici</i>, the development of which again
is proportionate to that of the nerves. The mutual relation of the
two nerves immediately after their origin is very characteristic of
the sub-classes of fishes. In the <i>Cyclostomes</i> they have no
further connection with each other, each going to the eye of its
own side.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> In the <i>Teleostei</i> they simply cross each other
(<i>decussate</i>), so that the one starting from the right half of
the brain goes to the left eye and <i>vice versa</i>. Finally, in
<i>Palæichthyes</i> the two nerves are fused together, immediately
after their origin, into a <i>chiasma</i>. The nerve is cylindrical for
some portion of its course, but in most fishes gradually changes this
form into that of a plaited band, which is capable of separation and
expansion. It enters the bulbus generally behind and above its axis.
The foramen through which it leaves the skull of Teleostei is generally
in a membranous portion of its anterior wall, or, where ossification
has taken place, in the orbito-sphenoid.</p>


<p class="center">B. <i>Nerves proper taking their origin from the brain</i><br>
(Figs. <a href="#fig41">41–45</a>).</p>

<p>The <i>Nervus oculorum motorius</i> (<i>third pair</i>) takes its
origin from the Pedunculus cerebri, close behind the lobi inferiores;
it escapes through the orbito-sphenoid, or the membrane replacing it,
and is distributed to the musculi rectus superior, rectus internus,
obliquus inferior, and rectus inferior. Its size corresponds to the
development of the muscles of the eye. Consequently it is absent in
the blind <i>Amblyopsis</i>, and the Myxinoids. In <i>Lepidosiren</i>
the nerves supplying the muscles of the eye have no independent
origin, but are part<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span> of the ophthalmic division of the Trigeminus.
In <i>Petromyzon</i> these muscles are supplied partly from the
Trigeminus, partly by a nerve representing the Oculo-motor and
Trochlearis, which are fused into a common trunk.</p>

<p>The <i>Nervus trochlearis</i> (<i>fourth pair</i>), if present with
an independent origin, is always thin, taking its origin on the
upper surface of the brain from the groove between lobus opticus and
cerebellum; it goes to the Musculus obliquus superior of the eye.</p>


<p class="center">C. <i>Nerves taking their origin from the Medulla oblongata</i>
(Figs. <a href="#fig41">41–45</a>).</p>

<p>The <i>Nervus abducens</i> (<i>sixth pair</i>) issues on the lower
surface of the brain, taking its origin from the anterior pyramids of
the Medulla oblongata, and supplies the Musculus rectus externus of the
eye, and the muscle of the nictitating membrane of Sharks.</p>

<p>The <i>Nervus trigeminus</i> (<i>fifth pair</i>) and the <i>Nervus
facialis</i> (<i>seventh pair</i>) have their origins close
together, and enter into intimate connection with each other. In the
Chondropterygians and most Teleostei the number of their roots is four,
in the Sturgeons five, and in a few Teleostei three. When there are
four, the first issues immediately below the cerebellum from the side
of the Medulla oblongata; it contains motory and sensory elements for
the maxillary and suspensorial muscles, and belongs exclusively to
the trigeminal nerve. The second root, which generally becomes free
a little above the first, supplies especially the elements for the
Ramus palatinus, which sometimes unites with parts of the Trigeminal,
sometimes with the Facial nerve. The third root, if present, is very
small, and issues immediately in front of the acustic nerve, and
supplies part of the motor elements of the facial nerve. The fourth
root is much stronger, sometimes double, and its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span> elements pass again
partly into the Trigeminal, partly into the Facial nerve. On the
passage of these stems through the skull (through a foramen or foramina
in the alisphenoid) they form a ganglionic plexus, in which the
palatine ramus and the first stem of the Trigeminus generally possess
discrete ganglia. The branches which issue from the plexus and belong
exclusively to the Trigeminus, supply the organs and integuments of the
frontal, ophthalmic, and nasal regions, and the upper and lower jaws
with their soft parts. The Facial nerve supplies the muscles of the
gill-cover and suspensorium, and emits a strong branch accompanying
the Meckelian cartilage to the symphysis, and another for the hyoid
apparatus.</p>

<p>The <i>Nervus acusticus</i> (<i>eighth pair</i>) is strong, and takes
its origin immediately behind, and in contact with, the last root of
the seventh pair.</p>

<p>The <i>Nervus glossopharyngeus</i> (<i>ninth pair</i>)<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> takes its
origin between the roots of the eighth and tenth nerves, and issues in
Teleostei from the cranial cavity by a foramen of the exoccipital. In
the Cyclostomes and Lepidosiren it is part of the Nervus vagus. It is
distributed in the pharyngeal and lingual regions, one branch supplying
the first branchial arch. After having left the cranial cavity it
swells into a ganglion, which in Teleostei is always in communication
with the sympathic nerve.</p>

<p>The <i>Nervus vagus</i> or <i>pneumogastricus</i> (<i>tenth pair</i>)
rises in all Teleostei and Palæichthyes with two discrete strong roots:
the first constantly from the swellings of the corpora restiformia,
be they thinner or thicker and overlying the sinus rhomboidalis, or
be they developed into lateral plaited pads, as in Acipenser and
Chondropterygians. The second much thicker root rises from the lower
tracts of the medulla oblongata. Both stems leave the cranial cavity by
a common foramen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span> situated in Teleosteous fishes in the exoccipital;
and form ganglionic swellings, of which those of the lower stem are the
more conspicuous. The lower stem has mixed elements, motory as well as
sensory, and is distributed to the muscles of the branchial arches and
pharynx, the œsophagus and stomach; it sends filaments to the heart
and to the air-bladder where it exists. The first (upper) stem forms
the <i>Nervus lateralis</i>. This nerve, which accompanies the lateral
mucous system of the trunk and tail, is either a single longitudinal
stem, gradually becoming thinner behind, running superficially below
the skin (Salmonidæ, Cyclopterus), or deeply between the muscles
(Sharks, Chimæra), or divided into two parallel branches (most
Teleostei): thus in the Perch there are two branches on each side, the
superficial of which supplies the lateral line, whilst the deep-seated
branch communicates with the spinal nerves and supplies the septa
between the myocommas and the skin. In fishes which lack the lateral
muciferous system and possess hard integuments, as the Ostracions, the
lateral nerve is more or less rudimentary. It is entirely absent in
Myxinoids, but the gastric branches of the Vagus are continued, united
as a single nerve, along the intestine to the anus.</p>

<p>No fish possesses a <i>Nervus accessorius</i>. Also a separate
<i>Nervus hypoglossus</i> (<i>twelfth pair</i>)<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> is absent, but
elements from the first spinal nerve are distributed in the area
normally supplied by this nerve in higher vertebrates.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The number of <i>Spinal</i> nerves corresponds to that of the vertebræ,
through or between which they pass out. Each nerve has two roots,
an anterior and posterior, the former of which has no ganglion, and
exclusively contains motor elements. The posterior or dorsal has a
ganglionic enlargement,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span> and contains sensory elements only. After
leaving the vertebral canal each spinal nerve usually divides into
a dorsal and ventral branch. The Gadoids show that peculiarity that
each of the posterior roots of some or many of the spinal nerves
possesses two separate threads, each of which has a ganglion of its
own; the one of these threads joins the dorsal and the other the
ventral branch. In fishes in which the spinal chord is very short, as
in Plectognaths, Lophius, the roots of the nerves are extremely long,
forming a thick <i>Cauda equina</i>. The additional function which
the (five) anterior spinal nerves of <i>Trigla</i> have to perform
in supplying the sensitive pectoral appendages and their muscles has
caused the development of a paired series of globular swellings of the
corresponding portion of the spinal chord. A similar structure is found
in <i>Polynemus</i>.</p>

(Gurnard), showing the globular swellings at the base of the

  </div>

<p>A <i>Sympathic nervous</i> system appears to be absent in
<i>Branchiostoma</i>, and has not yet been clearly made out in
<i>Cyclostomes</i>. It is well developed in the <i>Palæichthyes</i>,
but without cephalic portion. This latter is present in all Osseous
fishes, in which communication of the Sympathic has been found to exist
with all cerebral nerves, except the olfactory, optic, and acustic.
The sympathic trunks run along each side of the aorta and the back of
the abdomen into the hæmal canal; communicate in their course with the
ventral branches of each of the spinal nerves; and, finally, often
blend together into a common trunk beneath the tail. At the points of
communication with the cerebral and spinal nerves frequently ganglia
are developed, from which nerves emerge which are distributed to the
various viscera.</p>

<h2 class="smaller">CHAPTER VII.<br>
<span class="subhed">THE ORGANS OF SENSE.</span></h2></div>

<p>Characteristic of the <i>Organ of Smell</i> in Fishes is that it has
no relation whatever to the respiratory function, with the exception
of the <i>Dipnoi</i>, in which possibly part of the water received for
respiration passes through the nasal sac.</p>

<p>The olfactory organ is single in <i>Branchiostoma</i> and the
<i>Cyclostomes</i>. In the former a small depression on the front end
of the body, clothed with a ciliated epithelium, is regarded as a
rudimentary organ of smell. In the adult <i>Petromyzon</i> a membranous
tube leads from the single opening on the top of the head into the
cartilaginous olfactory capsule, the inside of which is clothed by
membranes prolonged into a posterior blind tube (Fig. <a href="#fig30">30</a>, <i>s</i>),
which penetrates the cartilaginous roof of the palate, but not the
mucous membrane of the buccal cavity. In the Myxinoids the outer tube
is strengthened by cartilaginous rings like a trachea; the capsule is
lined by a longitudinally folded pituitary membrane, and the posterior
tube opens backwards on the roof of the mouth; the opening is provided
with a valve.</p>

<p>In all other Fishes the organ of smell is double, one being on each
side; it consists of a sac lined with a pituitary membrane, and
without, or with one or two, openings. The position of these openings
is very different in the various orders or suborders of Fishes.</p>

<p>In the <i>Dipnoi</i> the nasal sac opens downwards by two wide openings
which are within the boundaries of the cavity of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span> mouth. The
pituitary membrane is transversely folded, the transverse folds being
divided by one longitudinal fold. The walls of the sac are strengthened
by sundry small cartilages.</p>

<p>Also in <i>Chondropterygians</i> the openings, of which there is one
to each sac, are on the lower part of the snout, and in the Rays,
Holocephali, and some Sharks, each extends into the cleft of the mouth.
The openings are protected by valvular flaps, supported by small
cartilages, and moved by muscles, whence it may be concluded that these
fishes are able to scent (actively) as well as to smell (passively).</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="fig47" style="max-width: 315px">
     <img
    class="p1"   
    src="images/fig47.jpg"
     alt="">
     <p class="p0 center smaller">Fig. 47.—Nostrils of <i>Raia lemprieri</i>, with nasal
flaps reverted.</p>
  </div>

<p>In the majority of <i>Teleostei</i> the olfactory capsules are lateral
or superior on the snout, covered externally by the skin, each usually
pierced by two openings, which are either close together, or more or
less remote from each other; the posterior is generally open, the
anterior provided with a valve or tube. In the <i>Chromides</i> and
<i>Labroidei ctenoidei</i> a single opening only exists for each
sac. In the <i>Murænidæ</i> the two openings of each side are either
superior, or lateral, or labial, that is, they are continued downwards
and pierce the margin of the upper lip. In many Tetrodonts nasal
openings are absent, and replaced by a conical papilla, in which the
olfactory nerve terminates.</p>

<p>It is certain that fishes possess the faculty of perceiving odours,
and that various scents attract or repel them. A mangled carcase
or fresh blood attracts Sharks as well as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span> voracious Serrasal
monoids of the South American rivers. There is no reason to doubt that
the seat of that perception is in the olfactory sac; and it may be
reasonably conjectured that its strength depends mainly on the degree
of development indicated by the number and extent of the interior folds
of the pituitary membrane.</p>

<p><i>Organ of Sight</i>.—The position, direction, and dimensions of the
eyes of fishes vary greatly. In some they have an upward aspect, and
are often very close together; in others they are lateral, and in a
few they are even directed downwards. The Flat-fishes represent the
extraordinary anomaly that both eyes are on the same side of the head,
and rarely on the same level, one being generally placed more forward
than the other. In certain species of marine fishes the eyes are of
an extraordinary size, a peculiarity indicating that the fish either
lives at a great depth, to which only a small proportion of the rays
of light penetrate, or that it is of nocturnal habits. In fishes which
have descended to such great depths that no rays whatever can reach
them, or in freshwater fishes living in caves, or in species which
grovel and live constantly in mud, the eyes are more or less aborted,
sometimes quite rudimentary, and covered by the skin. In very few this
organ appears to be entirely absent. In some Gobioids and Trachinoids
(<i>Periophthalmus</i>, <i>Boleophthalmus</i>, <i>Uronoscopus</i>,
etc.) the eyes, which are on the upper side of the head, can be
elevated and depressed at the will of the fish. In the range of their
vision and acuteness of sight, Fishes are very inferior to the higher
classes of Vertebrates, yet at the same time it is evident that they
perceive their prey or approaching danger from a considerable distance;
and it would appear that the visual powers of a <i>Periophthalmus</i>,
when hunting insects on mud-flats of the tropical coasts, are quite
equal to that of a frog. Again, the discrimination with which fishes
sometimes prefer one colour or kind of artificial fly to another
affords<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span> sufficient evidence that the vision, at least of certain
species is by no means devoid of clearness and precision.</p>

<p>The eye of <i>Branchiostoma</i> is of the most rudimentary condition.
It is simply a minute speck coated by dark pigment, and receiving
the end of a short nerve. In <i>Myxinoids</i> the minute rudiment of
the eye is covered by the skin and muscles. This is also the case
in many of the blind Teleosteous fishes; however, whilst in the
former fishes the organ of sight has not attained to any degree of
development, the rudimentary eye of blind Teleostei is a retrogressive
formation, in which often a lens and other portions of the eye can
be recognised. In fishes with a well-developed eye it is imbedded in
a layer of gelatinous and adipose substance, which covers the cavity
of the orbit. A lacrymal gland is absent. In the orbit of one fish
only, <i>Chorismodentex</i>, an organ has been found which can be
compared to a <i>saccus lacrymalis</i>. It is a round, blind, wide
sac, of the size of a pea, situated below the anterior corner of
the orbit, between the maxillary bone and the muscles of the cheek,
communicating by a rather wide foramen with the orbital cavity. The
membrane by which it is formed is continuous with that coating the
orbita. In the Chondropterygians the eyeball is supported by and moves
on a cartilaginous peduncle of the orbital wall. In the majority
of Teleosteans, and in Acipenser, a fibrous ligament attaches the
sclerotic to the wall of the orbit. The proper muscles of the eyeball
exist in all fishes, and consist of the four <i>Musculi recti</i>
and the two <i>M. obliqui</i>. In many Teleostei the former rise
from a subcranial canal, the origin of the <i>M. rectus externus</i>
being prolonged farthest backwards. The <i>Recti</i> muscles are
extraordinarily long in the Hammerheaded Sharks, in which they extend
from the basis cranii along the lateral prolongations of the head to
the eyes, which are situated at the extremities of the hammer.</p>

<p>In all fishes the general integument of the head passes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span> over the
eye, and becomes transparent where it enters the orbit; sometimes it
simply passes over the orbit, sometimes it forms a circular fold. The
anterior and posterior portions may be especially broad and the seat
of an adipose deposit (<i>adipose eyelids</i>), as in <i>Scomber</i>,
<i>Caranx</i>, <i>Mugil</i>, etc. In many of these fishes the extent
of these eyelids varies with the seasons; during the spawning season
they are so much loaded with fat as nearly to hide the whole eye. Many
Sharks possess a <i>nictitating</i> membrane, developed from the lower
part of the palpebral fold, and moved by a proper set of muscles.</p>

<i>ch</i>, choroid gland; <i>r</i>, retina; <i>f</i>, processus
falciformis; <i>h</i>, humor vitreus; <i>l</i>, lens; <i>i</i>,
iris.</p>
  </div>

<p>The form of the <i>bulbus</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig48">48</a>) is subhemispherical, the cornea
(<i>co</i>) being flat. If it were convex, as in higher Vertebrates,
it would be more liable to injury; but being level with the side
of the head the chances of injury by friction are diminished. The
<i>sclerotica</i> (<i>sc</i>) is cartilaginous in Chondropterygians
and Acipensers, fibrous and of varying thickness in Teleosteans, in
the majority of which it is supported by a pair of cartilaginous
or ossified hemispheroid cups (<i>c</i>). In a few fishes, as in
<i>Ceratodus</i>, <i>Xiphias</i>, the cups are confluent into one
cup, which possesses a foramen behind to allow the passage of the
optic nerve (<i>o</i>). The <i>cornea</i> of <i>Anableps</i> shows an
unique peculiarity. It is crossed by a dark horizontal stripe of the
conjunctiva, dividing it into an upper and lower portion; also the iris
is perforated by two pupils. This fish is observed to swim frequently
with half of its head out of the water, and it is a fact that it can
see out of the water as well as in it.</p>

<p>The membranes situated between the sclerotica and retina are
collectively called <i>choroidea</i>, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span> three in number. The one
in immediate contact with the sclerotic, and continued upon the iris,
is by no means constantly present; it is the <i>membrana argentea</i>
(<i>a</i>), and composed of microscopical crystals reflecting a silvery
or sometimes golden lustre. The middle layer is the <i>membrana
vasculosa</i> s. <i>halleri</i> (<i>v</i>), the chief seat of the
ramifications of the choroid vessels; the innermost layer is the
<i>membrana ruyscheana</i> or <i>uvea</i> (<i>u</i>), which is composed
of hexagonal pigment-cells, usually of a deep brown or black colour.</p>

<p>In many <i>Teleostei</i> a <i>rete mirabile</i> surrounds the entry
of the optic nerve; it is situated between the membrana argentea and
vasculosa, and called the <i>choroid gland</i> (<i>ch</i>). It receives
its arterial blood from the artery issuing from the pseudobranchia;
the presence of a choroid gland always being combined with that of
a pseudobranchia. Teleosteans without pseudobranchia lack a choroid
gland. In the Palæichthyes, on the other hand, the pseudobranchia is
present and a choroid gland absent.</p>

<p>The <i>iris</i> (<i>i</i>) is merely the continuation of the choroid
membrane; its capability of contracting and expanding is much more
limited than in higher Vertebrates. The <i>pupil</i> is generally
round, sometimes horizontally or vertically elliptical, sometimes
fringed. In the Rays and Pleuronectidæ a lobe descends from the upper
margin of the pupil, and the outer integument overlying this lobe is
coloured and non-transparent; a structure evidently preventing light
from entering the eye from above.</p>

<p>In most <i>Teleostei</i> a fold of the <i>Choroidea</i>, called the
<i>Processus falciformis</i> (<i>f</i>), extends from the vicinity of
the entrance of the optic nerve to the lens. It seems to be constantly
absent in Ganoids.</p>

<p>The <i>retina</i> (<i>r</i>) is the membrane into which the optic nerve
penetrates, and in which its terminal filaments are distributed. It
consists of several layers (Fig. <a href="#fig49">49</a>). The outermost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span> is an extremely
delicate membrane (<i>a</i>), followed by a layer of nerve-cells
(<i>b</i>), from which the terminal filaments issue, passing through
several granular strata (<i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>), on which the
innermost stratum rests. This stratum is composed of cylindrical rods
(<i>f</i>) vertically arranged, between which twin fusiform corpuscles
(<i>g</i>) are intercalated. This last layer is thickly covered with
a dark pigment. The retina extends over a portion of the iris, and a
well-defined raised rim runs along its anterior margin.</p>

  </div>

<p>The <i>vitreous humour</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig48">48</a>, <i>h</i>) which fills the
posterior cavity of the eyeball, is of a firmer consistency than in the
higher Vertebrates. The <i>lens</i> is spherical, or nearly so; firm,
denser towards the centre, and lies in a hollow of the vitreous humour.
When a falciform process is present, it is with one end attached to
the lens, which is thus steadied in its position. It consists of
concentric layers consisting of fibres, which in the nucleus of the
body have marginal teeth, by which they are interlocked together. In
<i>Petromyzon</i> this serrature is absent, or but faintly indicated.</p>

     <p class="p0 center smaller">Fig. 50.—Interlocking fibres of lens, highly magnified.</p>
  </div>

<p>The anterior cavity of the eye is very small in Fishes, in consequence
of the small degree of convexity of the cornea; the quantity of the
aqueous humour, therefore, is very small, just sufficient to float the
free border of the iris; and the lessened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span> refractive power of the
aqueous humour is compensated by the greater convexity of the lens.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>Organ of Hearing.</i>—No trace of an organ of hearing has been
found in <i>Branchiostoma</i>. In the <i>Cyclostomes</i> the labyrinth
is enclosed in externally visible cartilaginous capsules laterally
attached to the skull; it consists of a single <i>semicircular
canal</i> in the Myxinoids, whilst the Petromyzontes possess two
semicircular canals with a <i>vestibulum</i>.</p>

<p>In all other fishes the labyrinth consists of a vestibule and three
semicircular canals, the vestibule dilating into one or more sacs which
contain the otoliths. A tympanum, tympanic cavity, and external parts,
are entirely absent in the class of fishes.</p>

<p>In the <i>Chondropterygians</i> and <i>Dipnoi</i>, the labyrinth is
enclosed in the cartilaginous substance of the skull. In the former the
excavation in the cartilage is larger than the membranous labyrinth,
but nearly corresponds to it in form; the part which receives the
membranous vestibulum is called <i>Vestibulum cartilagineum</i>, from
which a canal issues and penetrates to the surface of the skull, where
it is closed by the skin in Sharks, but opens by a minute foramen in
Rays. The otolithic contents are soft and chalklike.</p>

<p>In the <i>Holocephali</i> part of the labyrinth is enclosed in the
cartilage of the skull, another part being in the cranial cavity, as
in Ganoids and Teleosteans. The membranous vestibulum is continued by
a canal to a single opening in the roof of the skull, from which two
smaller canals are continued to two small foramina in the skin covering
the occipital region.</p>

<p>In the <i>Teleosteans</i> the sac which contains the otoliths lies on
each side of the base of the cranial cavity and is often divided by a
septum into two compartments of unequal size, each containing a firm
and solid <i>otolith</i>; these bodies (Fig. <a href="#fig51">51</a>), possess indented
margins, frequently other impressions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span> and grooves, in which nerves
from the N. acusticus are lodged; they vary much in size and form,
but in both respects show a remarkable constancy in the same kind of
fishes. The vestibule is outwards in contact with the osseous side wall
of the skull, inwards with the metencephalon and medulla oblongata; it
contains another firm concretion, and opens by five foramina into the
three semicircular canals. The terminations of the acustic nerve are
distributed over the vestibular concretion and the ampulliform ends
(Fig. <a href="#fig52">52</a> <i>p</i>) of the semicircular canals, without being continued
into the latter, which are filled with fluid. The semicircular canals
(Fig. <a href="#fig52">52</a> <i>g</i>), are sometimes lodged in the cranial bones,
sometimes partly free in the cranial cavity. Many Teleostei have
fontanelles in the roof of the skull, closed by skin or very thin bone
only at the place where the auditory organ approaches the surface, by
which means sonorous undulations must be conducted with greater ease to
the ear.</p>

  </div>

<p>In many Teleostei a most remarkable relation obtains between the organ
of hearing and the air-bladder. In the most simple form this connection
is established in Percoids and the allied families, in which the two
anterior horns of the air-bladder are attached to fontanelles of the
occipital region of the skull, the vestibulum occupying the opposite
side of the membrane by which the fontanelle is closed. The condition
is similar, but more complicated in many Clupeoids. The anterior narrow
end of the air-bladder is produced into a canal at the base of the
skull, and divided into two very narrow branches, which again bifurcate
and terminate in a globular swelling. An appendage of the vestibulum
meets the anterior of these swellings, and comes into close contact
with it. Besides, the two vestibules communicate with each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span> other by a
transverse canal, crossing the cranial cavity below the brain.</p>

substance of the basi-occipital; this communicates on each side by a
small orifice with two subspherical atria, on the body of the atlas,
close to the foramen magnum. Each atrium is supported externally by a
small bone (<i>m</i>); a third larger bone (<i>k</i>) completes the
communication with the anterior part of the air-bladder. From the
sinus impar a bifid canal penetrates into the alisphenoids, in which
it terminates. In <i>Cobitis</i> and several Loach-like Siluroids the
small air-bladder consists of two globular portions placed side by
side, and wholly included within two bullæ, formed by the modified
parapophyses of the second and third vertebræ. The three ossicles on
each side are present, but concealed by the fore part of the osseous
bulla.</p>

<p><i>Organ of Taste.</i>—Some fishes, especially vegetable feeders, or
those provided with broad molar-like teeth, masticate their food; and
it may be observed in Carps and other Cyprinoid fish, that this process
of mastication frequently takes some time. But the majority of fish
swallow their food rapidly, and without mastication, and therefore we
may conclude that the sense of taste cannot be acute. The tongue is
often entirely absent, and even when it exists in its most distinct
state, it consists merely of ligamentous or cellular substance, and
is never furnished with muscles capable of producing the movements of
extension or retraction as in most higher Vertebrates. A peculiar organ
on the roof of the palate of Cyprinoids, is perhaps an organ adapted
for perception of this sense; in these fishes the palate between and
below the upper pharyngeal bones is cushioned with a thick, soft
contractile substance, richly supplied with nerves from the Nervi vagus
and glossopharyngeus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span></p>

<p><i>Organs of Touch.</i>—The faculty of touch is more developed than
that of taste, and there are numerous fishes which possess special
organs of touch. Most fishes are very sensitive to external touch,
although their body may be protected by hard horny scales. They
perceive impressions even on those parts which are covered by osseous
scutes, in the same manner as a tortoise perceives the slightest touch
of its carapace. The seat of the greatest sensitiveness, however,
appears to be the snout and the labial folds surrounding the mouth.
Many species possess soft and delicate appendages, called barbels,
which are almost constantly in action, and clearly used as organs of
touch. Among the <i>Triglidæ</i> and allied families, there are many
species which have one or more rays of the pectoral fin detached from
the membrane, and supplied with strong nerves. Such detached rays (also
found in the <i>Polynemidæ</i>, <i>Bathypterois</i>) are used partly
for locomotion, partly for the purpose of exploring the ground over
which the fish moves.</p>

<p>Some fish appear to be much less sensitive than others, or at least
lose their sensitiveness under peculiar circumstances. It is well known
that a Pike, whose mouth has been lacerated and torn by the hook,
continues to yield to the temptation of a bait immediately afterwards.
The Greenland Shark when feeding on the carcass of a whale allows
itself to be repeatedly stabbed in the head without abandoning its
prey. A pair of Congers are so dead to external impression at the time
of copulation, and so automatically, as it were, engaged, that they
have been taken by the hand together out of the water.</p>

<h2 class="smaller">CHAPTER VIII.<br>
<span class="subhed">THE ORGANS OF NUTRITION AND DIGESTION.</span></h2></div>

<p>Fishes are either exclusively carnivorous or herbivorous, but not a few
feed on vegetable substances as well as animal, or on mud containing
alimentary substance in a living or decomposing state. Generally they
are very voracious, especially the carnivorous kinds, and the rule of
“eat or be eaten” applies to them with unusual force. They are almost
constantly engaged in the pursuit and capture of their prey, the
degree of their power in these respects depending on the dimensions
of the mouth and gullet and the strength of the teeth and jaws. If
the teeth are sharp and hooked, they are capable of securing the most
slender and agile animals; if this kind of teeth is combined with a
wide gullet and distensible stomach, they are able to overpower and
swallow other fish larger than themselves; if the teeth are broad,
strong molars, they are able to crush the hardest aliments; if they
are feeble, they are only serviceable in procuring some small or inert
and unresisting prey. Teeth may be wanting altogether. Whatever the
prey, in the majority of cases it is swallowed whole; but some of the
most voracious fishes, like some Sharks and <i>Characinidæ</i>, are
provided with cutting teeth, which enable them to tear their prey to
pieces if too large to be swallowed whole. Auxiliary organs for the
purpose of overpowering their prey, which afterwards is seized or torn
by the teeth, like the claws of some carnivorous mammals and birds, are
not found in this class; but in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span> few fishes the jaws themselves are
modified for that purpose. In the Sword-fishes the bones of the upper
jaw form a long dagger-shaped weapon, with which they not only attack
large animals, but also frequently kill fishes on which they feed.
The Saw-fishes are armed with a similar but still more complicated
weapon, the saw, which is armed on each side with large teeth implanted
in deep sockets, specially adapted for killing and tearing the prey
before it is seized and masticated by the small teeth within the mouth.
Fishes show but little choice in the selection of their food, and some
devour their own offspring indiscriminately with other fishes. Their
digestive powers are strong and rapid, but subject in some degree to
the temperature, which, when sinking below a certain point, lowers the
vital powers of these cold-blooded animals. On the whole, marine fishes
are more voracious than those inhabiting fresh waters; and whilst the
latter may survive total abstinence from food for weeks or months,
the marine species succumb to hunger within a few days. The growth of
fishes depends greatly on the nature and supply of food, and different
individuals of the same species may exhibit a great disparity in their
respective dimensions. They grow less rapidly and to smaller dimensions
in small ponds or shallow streams than in large lakes and deep rivers.
The young of coast fishes, when driven out to sea, where they find
a much smaller supply of food, remain in an undeveloped condition,
assuming an hydropic appearance. The growth itself seems to continue
in most fishes for a great length of time, and we can scarcely set
bounds to—certainly we know not with precision—the utmost range of
the specific size of fishes. Even among species in no way remarkable
for their dimensions we sometimes meet with old individuals, favourably
situated, which more or less exceed the ordinary weight and measurement
of their kind. However, there are certain evidently short-lived species
of fishes which attain a remarkably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span> uniform size within a very short
time; for instance, the Stickleback, many species of <i>Gobius</i> and
<i>Clupea</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The organs of nutrition, manducation, and deglutition, are lodged in
two large cavities—an anterior (the mouth or <i>buccal cavity</i>),
and a posterior (the <i>abdominal cavity</i>). In the former the
alimentary organs are associated with those fulfilling the respiratory
functions, the transmission of food to the stomach and of water to the
gills being performed by similar acts of deglutition. The abdominal
cavity commences immediately behind the head, so, however, that an
extremely short thoracic cavity for the heart is partitioned off
in front. Beside the alimentary organs it contains also those of
the urogenital system and the air-bladder. The abdominal cavity is
generally situated in the trunk only, but in numerous fishes it extends
into the tail, being continued for some distance along each side of the
hæmal apophyses.</p>

<p>In numerous fishes the abdominal cavity opens outwards by one or two
openings. A single <i>porus abdominalis</i> in front of the vent
is found in <i>Lepidosiren</i> and some Sturgeons; a paired one,
one on each side of the vent, in <i>Ceratodus</i>, some species of
Sturgeon, <i>Lepidosteus</i>, <i>Polypterus</i>, <i>Amia</i>, and all
Chondropterygians. As in these fishes semen and ova are discharged by
proper ducts, the abdominal openings may serve for the expulsion of
semen, and those ova only which, having lost their way to the abdominal
aperture of the oviduct, would be retained in the abdominal cavity.
In those <i>Teleosteans</i> which lack an oviduct a single <i>porus
genitalis</i> opens <i>behind</i> the vent.</p>

<p>The <i>mouth</i> of fishes shows extreme variation with regard to
form, extent, and position. Generally opening in front, it may be
turned upwards, or may lie at the lower side of the snout, as in most
Chondropterygians, Sturgeons, and some Teleosteans. Vogt regards this
position as a persistent fœtal condition. In most fishes the jaws are
covered by the skin,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span> which, before passing over the jaws, is often
folded, forming more or less fleshy lips. In the Sharks the skin
retains its external character even within the teeth, but in other
fishes it changes into a mucous membrane. A <i>tongue</i> may exist as
a more or less free and short projection, formed by the glosso*-hyal
and a soft covering, or may be entirely absent. <i>Salivary</i> glands
and a <i>velum palati</i> are absent in fishes.</p>

<p>With regard to the <i>dentition</i>, the class of Fishes offers an
amount of variation such as is not found in any of the other classes
of Vertebrates. As the teeth form one of the most important elements
in the classification of fishes, their special arrangement and form
will be referred to in the account of the various families and genera.
Whilst not a few fishes are entirely edentulous, in others most of the
bones of the buccal cavity, or some of them, may be toothed, as the
bones of the jaws, the palatines, pterygoids, vomers, basisphenoid,
glossohyal, branchial arches, upper and lower pharyngeals. In others
teeth may be found fixed in some portion of the buccal membrane without
being supported by underlying bone or cartilage; or the teeth have
been developed in membrane overlying one of the dentigerous bones
mentioned, without having become anchylosed to the bone. When the tooth
is fixed to the bone the attachment has generally been effected by the
ossification of the bone of the tooth, but in some fishes a process of
the bone projects into the cavity of the tooth; in others the teeth are
implanted in alveoli. In these, again, frequently a process of bone
rises from the bottom, on which the tooth rests.</p>

<p>Many fishes, especially predatory fishes with long, lancet-shaped
teeth, have all or some of the teeth capable of being bent inwards
towards the mouth. Such “hinged” teeth resume at once the upright
position when pressure is removed from them. They are, however,
depressible in one direction only, thus offering no obstacle to
the ingress, but opposing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span> egress of prey. Mr. C. S. Tomes has
shown that the means by which this mechanism is worked are different
in different fishes; for whilst, in the <i>Pediculati</i> and
<i>Gadoids</i> (Hake) the elasticity resides solely in the tissue of
the hinge (the tooth being as resilient as ever after everything else
is severed), in the Pike the hinge is not in the least endowed with
elasticity, but the bundles of fibres proceeding from the interior of
the dentine cap are exceedingly elastic.</p>

<p>As regards texture the teeth of fishes show considerable variation.
The conical teeth of the Cyclostomes and the setiform teeth of many
Teleosteans consist of a horny albuminous substance. The principal
substance of the teeth of other fishes consists of dentine, with
numerous dividing and anastomosing tubercles, sometimes covered
by a stratum of unvascular dentine. An enamel-like substance has
been observed on the crown of the teeth of <i>Sargus</i> and
<i>Balistes</i>, and an ossification of the capsule of their matrix
covers the enamel with a thin coating of cement. The teeth either
possess a cavity in which the matrix is received, or, more frequently,
they are solid, in which case vascular canals of the underlying bone
are continued into the substance of the tooth. In the teeth of some
fishes numerous sets of canals and tubes are so arranged that they do
not anastomose with one another, each set being surrounded by a layer
of dentine and cement. These apparently simple teeth are evidently
composed of numerous small teeth, and called <i>compound</i> teeth.</p>

<p>The teeth may be, and generally are, very different as regards size or
form in the different parts of the mouth; they may be also different
according to the age or sex of the fish (<i>Raja</i>). The teeth may
be few in number and <i>isolated</i>, or placed in a single, double,
or triple <i>series</i>, <i>distant</i> from one another or <i>closely
set</i>; they may form narrow or broad <i>bands</i>, or <i>patches</i>
of various forms. As regards form, they may be cylindrical or conical,
pointed, straight, or curved, with or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span> without an angular bent near
their base; some are compressed laterally or from the front backwards;
the latter may be triangular in shape, or truncated at the top like
incisors of mammals; they may have one apex (cusp) only, or be bi- or
tri-lobate (bi- or tri-cuspid); or have the margins denticulated or
serrated. Compressed teeth may be confluent, and form a cutting edge in
both jaws, which assume the shape of a parrot’s beak (Fig. <a href="#fig53">53</a>). In some
the apex is hooked or provided with barbs. Again, some teeth are broad,
with flat or convex surface, like molar teeth. With regard to size,
the finest teeth are like fine flexible bristles, <i>ciliiform</i> or
<i>setiform</i>; or, if very short and anchylosed to the bone, they
appear only as inconspicuous asperities of the bone. Very fine conical
teeth arranged in a band are termed <i>villiform</i> teeth; when they
are coarser, or mixed with coarser teeth, they are <i>card-like</i>
(dents en rape or en cardes) (Fig. <a href="#fig54">54</a>); molar-like teeth of very small
size are termed <i>granular</i>.</p>

     alt="">
     <p class="p0 center smaller">Fig. 53.—Jaws of Calliodon.</p>
  </div>

<p>In all fishes the teeth are constantly shed or renewed during the
whole course of their life. In fishes which have compound teeth, as
the Dipnoi, Chimæroids, Scari,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Gymnodonts, as well as in those
which have apparently permanent teeth, as in the saw of <i>Pristis</i>,
the detrition of the surface is made up by a constant growth of the
tooth from its base. When the teeth are implanted in alveoli, they
are generally succeeded by others in the vertical direction, but in
others they succeed one another, side by side. In the majority of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
fishes the new tooth is not developed (as in reptiles and mammals) in
a diverticulum of the sack of its predecessor, but like this from the
free surface of the buccal membrane. Generally there are more than one
tooth growing, which are in various stages of development, and destined
to replace the one in function. This is very conspicuous in Sharks,
in which the whole phalanx of their numerous teeth is ever marching
slowly forwards (or in some backwards), in rotatory progress, over the
alveolar border of the jaw, the teeth being successively cast off after
having reached the outer margin, and fulfilled for a longer and shorter
period their special function.</p>

  </div>

<p>The <i>intestinal tract</i> is divided into four portions: œsophagus,
stomach, small and large intestine; two or more of these divisions
may coalesce in fishes and become indistinguishable. But it is
characteristic of the class that the urinary apertures are constantly
situated behind the termination of the intestinal tract.</p>

<p>In <i>Branchiostoma</i> the whole intestinal tract is straight, and
coated with a ciliated mucous membrane. The wide pharynx passes into a
narrow œsophagus, this into a gastric cavity, the remainder being again
narrower and terminating in the anal aperture, which lies somewhat
to the left of the median line. The liver is represented by a green
coloured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span> cœcal diverticulum of the stomachic dilatation. A mesenterium
is absent.</p>

<p>In the <i>Cyclostomi</i> the intestinal tract is likewise straight, and
without clearly defined divisions; however, in <i>Petromyzon</i> the
œsophagus shows numerous longitudinal folds, and the intestine proper
is provided with a single longitudinal fold. A mesentery, which is
present in the Myxinoids, is represented by a short median fold only,
by means of which the hindmost part of the intestine is fixed.</p>

<p>The <i>Palæichthyes</i> show differences in the structure of
their intestinal tract as considerable as are found among the
<i>Teleostei</i>, but they have that in common that the absorbent
surface of their intestine is enlarged by the development of a spiral
valve, evidence of the presence of which in extinct Palæichthyes is
still preserved in the fossilised fæces or <i>coproliths</i>, so
abundant in some of the older strata.</p>

<p>In <i>Chondropterygians</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig55">55</a>) the stomach is divided into a
cardiac and pyloric portion, the former frequently terminating in a
blind sac, and the latter varying in length. The pyloric portion is
bent at its origin and end, and separated from the short duodenum
(called <i>Bursa entiana</i> in these fishes) by a valve; the ductus
hepaticus and pancreaticus enter the duodenum. This is succeeded by
the straight intestine provided with the spiral valve, the coils
of which may be either longitudinal and wound vertically about the
axis of the intestine, as in <i>Carcharias</i>, <i>Galeocerdo</i>,
<i>Thalassorhinus</i>, and <i>Zygœna</i>, or they may be transverse
to that axis, as in the other genera. The number of gyrations in
the latter case varies: there may be as many as forty. The short
rectum passes into a cloaca, which contains also the orifices of the
urogenital ducts. Only the commencement and end of the intestinal tract
are fixed by mesenterial folds.</p>

<p>In the <i>Holocephali</i> and <i>Dipnoi</i>, the intestinal tract is
short, straight, and wide, without stomachic dilatation, a pyloric<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
valve, close to which the ductus choledochus enters, indicating
the boundary of the intestine proper (Fig. <a href="#fig57">57</a>, <i>p</i>). The
spiral valve is perfect, and makes from three (<i>Chimæra</i>)
to nine (<i>Ceratodus</i>) gyrations. A cloaca is present, as in
Chondropterygians. A mesentery fixing the dorsal side of the intestine
is absent.</p>

  </div>

<p>The other <i>Ganoids</i> resemble again more the Chondropterygians
in the structure of their intestinal tract. The stomach has always a
distinct pyloric portion, and has a still more complicated structure
in <i>Acipenser</i>. The duodenal portion receives the contents of
<i>Appendices pyloricæ</i>, which are confluent into a gland-like mass
in <i>Acipenser</i>, but separate in <i>Polyodon</i>, and numerous and
short in <i>Lepidosteus</i>, whilst <i>Polypterus</i> possesses one
such appendage only. A spiral valve is developed in the Sturgeons and
Polypterus, but in <i>Amia</i>, in which the intestine performs several
convolutions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span> the four gyrations of the valve are situated far back
towards the end of the intestine. In <i>Lepidosteus</i> the valve is
rudimentary, and indicated only by three raised lines crossing the
terminal portion of the intestine. In all these Ganoids the rectum has
a separate opening, without cloaca.</p>

<p>The structure of the intestinal tract of <i>Teleosteous</i> fishes
is subject to so numerous modifications that we should go beyond the
limits of the present work if we would attempt to enter into details.
Great differences in this respect may be found even in groups of the
same natural families. Frequently the intestinal tract remains of
nearly the same width throughout its course, and only the entrance
of the various ducts serves as a guide for the distinction of its
divisions. An intestine of such uniform width may be straight and
short, as in <i>Scombresocidæ</i>, <i>Symbranchidæ</i>, or it may
be more or less convoluted and long, as in many <i>Cyprinidæ</i>,
<i>Doradina</i>, etc. On the whole, carnivorous fishes have a much
shorter and simpler intestinal tract than herbivorous.</p>

<p>In the majority of Teleosteans, however, œsophagus, stomach, duodenum,
small intestine and rectum, can be more or less distinctly, even
externally distinguished.</p>

<p>There are two predominant forms of the stomach, intermediate forms
being, however, numerous. In the first, the <i>siphonal</i>, it
presents the form of a bent tube or canal, one-half of the horse-shoe
being the cardiac, the other the pyloric portion. In the second, the
<i>cæcal</i>, the cardiac division is prolonged into a long descending
blind sac, the cardiac and pyloric openings of the stomach lying close
together (<i>Clupea</i>, <i>Scomber</i>, <i>Thynnus</i>, etc.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span></p>

  </div>

<p>The duodenum receives always the hepatic and pancreatic secretions,
and, besides, those of the appendices pyloricæ, which, in varying
numbers (from 1 to 200), are of very common occurrence in Teleosteans
(Fig. <a href="#fig56">56</a>). They vary also in length<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span> and width, and whilst the
narrowest serve only as secretory organs, the widest are frequently
found filled with the same contents as the intestine. When few in
number, each opens by a separate duct into the duodenum; when their
number is greater two or more coalesce into a common duct; in the
latter case the appendages cease to be free, and are connected with one
another by a more or less firm tissue.</p>

<p>Cœcal appendages at the end of the intestinal tract are of exceedingly
rare occurrence in fishes (<i>Box</i>). There is no <i>cloaca</i> in
Teleosteans.</p>

<p>In the majority of Teleosteous fishes the <i>vent</i> is situated
on the boundary between trunk and tail, behind the ventral fins. In
a few it lies farther backwards, not far from the caudal fin; more
frequently it is advanced forwards, under the middle of the abdomen
or to the scapular arch. In two fishes, <i>Aphredoderus</i> and
<i>Amblyopsis</i>, it lies before the pectoral fins.</p>

<p>A peritoneum envelops all the divisions of the intestinal tract within
the abdominal cavity. A broad, well-developed <i>omentum</i> has
hitherto been found in <i>Gobiesox cephalus</i> only.</p>

<p><i>Liver</i>.—The existence of a liver in <i>Branchiostoma</i> as a
long diverticulum of the intestine has been mentioned above. In the
Myxinoids the liver is divided into two glandular bodies, an anterior
rounded smaller one, and a posterior larger one of an elongate shape.
The gall-bladder lies between both, and receives a cystic duct from
each of them. In the other fishes the proportionally large liver is a
single large gland, from which only now and then small portions are
found to be detached. It is either simple, or with a right and left
lobe, or with a third lobe in the middle; each lobe may have incisions
or subdivisions, which, however, are very inconstant. The liver of
fishes is distinguished by the great quantity of fluid fat (oil) which
it contains. The gall-bladder is but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span> rarely absent, and attached to
the right lobe, or towards the centre; however, in some fishes it
is detached from the liver and connected with it by the cystic duct
only. The bile may be conveyed by one or more hepatic ducts into a
common duct which is continued towards the gall-bladder as <i>ductus
cysticus</i>, and towards the duodenum as <i>ductus choledochus</i>; or
some of the hepatic ducts enter directly the gall-bladder, or directly
the duodenum, without communicating with the common duct. Individual
variations in this respect are of common occurrence.</p>

<p>A <i>pancreas</i> has been found hitherto in all Chondropterygians,
Acipenser, and many Teleosteans. In the first it is a glandular mass
of considerable size behind the stomach, close to the spleen; its duct
leads into the duodenum. In the Sturgeons the pancreas is attached to
the duodenum, and opens close to the ductus choledochus. In <i>Silurus
glanis</i> it is very large, and the ductus choledochus passes through
its substance; it is smaller in <i>Belone</i> and <i>Pleuronectes</i>,
and situated in the mesentery; its duct accompanies the terminal
portion of the ductus choledochus. In the Salmon, which possesses a
large lobed pancreas, the duct is so intimately connected with the
ductus choledochus that both appear externally as a single duct only.</p>

<p>The <i>spleen</i>, which is substantially a lymphatic gland, may be
mentioned here, as it is constantly situated in the immediate vicinity
of the stomach, generally near its cardiac portion. With the exception
of <i>Branchiostoma</i>, it is found in all fishes, and appears as a
rounded or oblong organ of dark-red colour. In the Sharks frequently
one or more smaller pieces are detached from the principal body. In
the Dipnoi a thin layer of a very soft substance of brownish-black
colour below the mucous membrane of the stomach and upper part of the
intestine has been regarded as the homologue of the spleen (Fig. <a href="#fig57">57</a>,
<i>m</i>). In most <i>Teleostei</i> the spleen is undivided, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>

<span class="subhed">ORGANS OF RESPIRATION.</span></h2></div>

<p>Fishes breathe the air dissolved in water by means of gills or
branchiæ. The oxygen consumed by them is not that which forms the
chemical constituent of the water, but that contained in the air which
is dissolved in water. Hence fishes transferred into water from which
the air has been driven out by a high temperature, or in which the
air absorbed by them is not replaced, are speedily suffocated. The
absorption of oxygen by fishes is comparatively small, and it has been
calculated that a man consumes 50,000 times more than is required by
a Tench. However, some fishes evidently require a much larger supply
of oxygen than others: Eels and Carps, and other fishes of similar
low vitality, can survive the removal out of their elements for days,
the small quantity of moisture retained in their gill-cavity being
sufficient to sustain life, whilst other fishes, especially such as
have very wide gill-openings, are immediately suffocated after being
taken out of the water. In some fishes noted for their muscular
activity, like the <i>Scombridæ</i>, the respiratory process is so
energetic as to raise the temperature of their blood far beyond that
of the medium in which they live. A few fishes, especially such as
are periodically compelled to live in water thickened into mud by
desiccation and vitiated by decomposing substances, breathe atmospheric
air, and have generally special contrivances for this purpose. These
are so much habituated to breathing air that many of them, even when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
brought into pure water of normal condition, are obliged to rise
to the surface at frequent intervals to take in a quantity of air,
and if they be kept beneath the surface by means of a gauze net,
they perish from suffocation. The special contrivances consist of
additional respiratory organs, lodged in cavities either adjoining the
gill-cavity or communicating with the ventral side of the œsophagus,
or of the air-bladder which enters upon respiratory functions (Dipnoi,
Lepidosteus, Amia).</p>

<p>The water used by fishes for respiration is received by the mouth, and
by an action similar to that of swallowing driven to the gills, and
expelled by the gill-openings, of which there may be one or several on
each side behind the head; rarely one only in the median line of the
ventral surface.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="fig58" style="max-width: 318px">

     <p class="p0 smaller">Fig. 58.—Fore-part of the body of an embryon of
Carcharias, showing the branchial filaments (natural size).</p>
  </div>

<p>The <i>gills</i> or <i>branchiæ</i> consist essentially of folds of
the mucous membrane of the gill-cavity (<i>laminæ branchiales</i>),
in which the capillary vessels are distributed. In all fishes the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
gills are lodged in a cavity, but during the embryonic stage the
Chondropterygians have the gill-laminæ prolonged into long filaments
projecting beyond the gill-cavity (Fig. <a href="#fig58">58</a>), and in a few young Ganoids
external gills are superadded to the internal.</p>

<p>In <i>Branchiostoma</i> the dilated pharynx is perforated by numerous
clefts, supported by cartilaginous rods (Fig. <a href="#fig29">29</a>, <i>h</i>). The water
passes between these clefts into the peritoneal cavity, and makes its
exit by the porus abdominalis situated considerably in advance of the
vent. The water is propelled by cilia.</p>

<p>In the <i>Cyclostomes</i> the gills of each side are lodged in a
series of six or more antero-posteriorly compressed sacs, separated
from each other by intervening septa. Each sac communicates by an
inner duct with the œsophagus, the water being expelled by an outer
duct. In <i>Bdellostoma</i> each outer duct has a separate opening,
but in <i>Myxine</i> all the outer ducts pass outwards by one common
gill-opening on each side. In the Lampreys the ducts are short, the
outer ones having separate openings (Fig. <a href="#fig2">2</a>, p. 39). The inner ducts
lead into a single diverticulum or bronchus, blind behind, situated
below the œsophagus, and communicating in front with the pharynx, where
it is provided with two valves by which the regurgitation of the water
into the buccal cavity is prevented.</p>

<p>The same type of branchial organs persists in <i>Chondropterygians</i>,
which possess five, rarely six or seven, flattened pouches with
transversely plaited walls. The septa between them are supported by
cartilaginous filaments rising from the hyoidean and branchial arches.
Each pouch opens by a cleft outwards, and by an aperture into the
pharynx, without intervening ducts. The anterior wall of the first
pouch is supported by the hyoidean arch. Between the posterior wall
of the first and the anterior of the second sac, and between the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
adjacent walls of the succeeding, a branchial arch with its two series
of radiating cartilaginous filaments is interposed. Consequently the
first and last pouch have one set of gill-laminæ only, viz. the first
on its posterior and the last on its anterior wall. The so-called
<i>spiracles</i> on the upper surface of the head of Chondropterygians
are to be referred to in connection with the respiratory organs. They
are the external openings of a canal leading on each side into the
pharynx, and situated generally close to and behind the orbit. They
frequently possess valves or an irregularly indented margin, and
are found in all species during the embryonic stage, but remaining
persistent in a part only. The spiracles are the remains of the first
visceral cleft of the embryo, and in the fœtal state long branchial
filaments have been observed to protrude, as from the other branchial
clefts.</p>

<p>The <i>Holocephali</i> and <i>Ganoidei</i> show numerous deviations
from the Chondropterygian type, all leading in the direction towards
the Teleosteans. As a whole they take an intermediate position between
the preceding types and the Teleosteans, but they show a great
variation among themselves, and have in common only the imperfect
separation of the branchial sacs and the presence of a single outer
branchial aperture.</p>

<p>In <i>Chimæra</i> the septum separating the branchial sacs is confluent
with the wall of the gill-cavity in a part of its extent only, and
still more imperfect is the separation of those branchial divisions in
<i>Ceratodus</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig60">60</a>). The other Ganoids show no such division
whatever. In <i>Chimæra</i> the first gill is incomplete (uniserial),
and belongs to the hyoid; then follow three complete gills; the last,
belonging to the fourth branchial arch, being again incomplete.
<i>Acipenser</i>, <i>Scaphirhynchus</i>, <i>Lepidosiren</i>,
<i>Protopterus</i>, and <i>Lepidosteus</i>, possess likewise an
anterior incomplete gill (<i>opercular gill</i>), followed by four
complete gills in the Sturgeons and <i>Lepidosteus</i>, whilst in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
<i>Lepidosiren</i> and <i>Protopterus</i> a part of the branchial
arches is gill-less. In <i>Polyodon</i>, <i>Ceratodus</i>, and
<i>Polypterus</i>, an opercular gill is absent, the two former having
four complete gills, the latter three and a half only. <i>Spiracles</i>
are still in some Ganoids present, viz. in the Sturgeons and
<i>Polypterus</i>. In all the Ganoids an osseous gill-cover is now
developed.</p>

<p>In the <i>Teleostei</i> the gills with their supporting branchial
arches lie in one undivided cavity; more or less wide clefts between
the arches lead from the pharynx to the gills, and a more or less wide
opening gives exit to the water after it has washed the gills. The
interbranchial clefts have sometimes nearly the same extent as the
branchial arches; sometimes they are reduced to small openings, the
integuments stretching from one arch to the other. Sometimes there is
no cleft behind the fourth arch, in which case this arch has only an
uniserial gill developed. The gill-opening likewise varies much in its
extent, and when reduced to a foramen may be situated at any place
of the posterior boundary of the head. In the <i>Symbranchidæ</i>
the gill-openings coalesce into a single narrow slit in the median
line of the isthmus. In the majority of Teleosteans the integument of
the concave side of the branchial arches develops a series of horny
protuberances of various form, the so-called <i>gill-rakers</i>. They
are destined to catch any solid corpuscles or substances which would be
carried into the gill-cavity with the water. In some fishes they are
setiform, and form a complete sieve, whilst in others they are merely
rough tubercles, the action of which must be very incomplete if they
have any function at all.</p>

<p>Most Teleosteans possess four complete gills, but frequently the
fourth arch is provided with an uniserial gill only, as mentioned
above, or even entirely gill-less. The most imperfect gills are
found in <i>Malthe</i>, which has two and a half gills only, and in
<i>Amphipnous cuchia</i>, in which one small gill is fixed to the
second arch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span></p>

<p>The gills of the Teleosteans as well as of the Ganoids are supported
by a series of solid cartilaginous or horny pointed rods, arranged
along the convex edges of the branchial arches. Arches bearing a
complete gill have two series of those rods, one along each edge;
those with uniserial gills bear one row of rods only. The rods are
not part of the arch, but fixed in its integument, the several
rods of one row corresponding to those of the other, forming pairs
(<i>feuillet</i>, Cuvier) (Fig. <a href="#fig59">59</a>). Each rod is covered by a loose
mucous membrane passing from one rod to its fellow opposite, which
again is finely transversely plaited, the general surface being
greatly increased by these plaits. In most Teleostei the branchial
lamellæ are compressed, and taper towards their free end, but in the
Lophobranchs their base is attenuated and the end enlarged. The mucous
membrane contains the finest terminations of the vessels, which, being
very superficial, impart the blood-red colour to living gills. The
<i>Arteria branchialis</i>, the course of which lies in the open canal
in the convexity of the branchial arch, emits a branch (<i>a</i>)
for every pair of lamellæ which ascends (<i>b</i>) along the inner
edge of the lamella, and supplies every one of the transverse plaits
with a branchlet. The latter break up into a fine net of capillaries,
from which the oxygenised blood is collected into venous branchlets,
returning by the venous branch (<i>d</i>), which occupies the outer
edge of the lamella.</p>

  </div>

<p>The so-called <i>Pseudobranchiæ</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig60">60</a>) are the remains of an
anterior gill which had respiratory functions during the embryonic
life of the individuals. By a change in the circulatory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span> system these
organs have lost those functions, and appear in the adult fish as
retia mirabilia, as they receive oxygenised blood, which, after having
passed through their capillary system, is carried to other parts
of the head. In Palæichthyes the pseudobranchia is a rete mirabile
caroticum for the brain and eye; in Teleosteans a rete mirabile
ophthalmicum only. Pseudobranchiæ are as frequently absent as present
in Chondropterygians as well as Teleosteans. As to the Ganoids,
they occur in <i>Ceratodus</i>, <i>Acipenser</i>, <i>Polyodon</i>,
and <i>Lepidosteus</i>, and are absent in <i>Lepidosiren</i>,
<i>Protopterus</i>, <i>Scaphirhynchus</i>, <i>Polypterus</i>, and
<i>Amia</i>.</p>

<p>In Chondropterygians and Sturgeons the pseudobranchiæ are situated
within the spiracles; in those, in which spiracles have become
obliterated, the pseudobranchiæ lie on the suspensorium, hidden
below cellular tissue; but pseudobranchiæ are not necessarily
co-existent with spiracles. In the other Ganoids and Teleosteans the
pseudobranchiæ (Fig. <a href="#fig60">60</a>, <i>h</i>) are within the gill-cavity, near
the base of the gill-cover; in <i>Ceratodus</i> even rudiments of the
gill-rakers (<i>x’</i>, <i>x”</i>) belonging to this embryonic gill
are preserved, part of them (<i>x”</i>) being attached to the hyoid
arch. Pseudobranchiæ are frequently hidden below the integuments of the
gill-cavity, and have the appearance of a glandular body rather than of
a gill.</p>

<p><i>Accessory respiratory organs</i> for retaining water or
breathing air, such as are found in the <i>Labyrinthici</i>,
<i>Ophiocephalidæ</i>, certain <i>Siluridæ</i>, and <i>Lutodira</i>,
are structures so specialised that they are better described in the
accounts of the Fishes in which they have been observed.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>Air-Bladder.</i>—The air-bladder, one of the most characteristic
organs of fishes, is a hollow sac, formed of several tunics, containing
gas, situated in the abdominal cavity, but without the peritoneal sac,
entirely closed or communicating by a duct with the intestinal tract.
Being compressible, its special functions consist in altering the
specific gravity of the fish or in changing the centre of gravity. In a
few fishes it assumes the function of the organ of higher Vertebrates,
of which it is the homologue—viz. of a <i>lung</i>.</p>

<p>The gas contained in the air-bladder is secreted from its inner
surface. In most freshwater fishes it consists of nitrogen, with a very
small quantity of oxygen and a trace of carbonic acid; in sea-fishes,
especially those living at some depth, oxygen predominates, as much
as 87 per cent having been found. Davy found in the air-bladder of a
fresh-run Salmon a trace of carbonic acid and 10 per cent of oxygen,
the remainder of the gas being nitrogen.</p>

<p>An air-bladder is absent in <i>Leptocardii</i>, <i>Cyclostomi</i>,
<i>Chondropterygii</i>, and <i>Holocephali</i>; but occurs in all
Ganoids, in which, besides, its respiratory functions more or less
clearly manifest themselves. Its occurrence in Teleosteans is most
irregular, closely allied species sometimes differing from each other
in this respect; it shows in this sub-class the most extraordinary
modifications, but has no respiratory function whatever.</p>

<p>Constantly situated within the abdominal cavity, below the vertebral
column, but without the sac of the peritoneum which covers only its
ventral portion, the air-bladder is frequently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span> prolonged into the
tail, the prolongation being either simple and lodged between the
non-united parapophyses, or double and penetrating between the muscles
and hæmapophyses of each side. In the opposite direction processes of
the air-bladder may penetrate into the skull, as has been mentioned
above (p. 117). In some fishes the air-bladder is almost loose in the
abdominal cavity, whilst in others it adheres most intimately by firm
and short tissue to the vertebral column, the walls of the abdomen, and
the intestines. In the Cobitina and many Siluroids it is more or less
completely enclosed in osseous capsules formed by the vertebræ.</p>

<p>The tunics of the majority of air-bladders are an extremely fine
internal one, frequently shining silvery, containing crystalline
corpuscles, sometimes covered with a pavement-epithelium; and a thicker
outer one of a fibrous texture, which sometimes attains to considerable
thickness and yields isinglass. This wall is strengthened in many
fishes by muscular layers for the compression of the whole organ or of
some portion of it.</p>

<p>A distinction has been made between air-bladders which communicate by
a duct with the intestinal tract and those which are entirely closed.
However, it is to be remembered that at an early stage of development
all air-bladders are provided with such a duct, which in a part of the
fishes more or less completely obliterates, being then represented by a
fine ligament only. In young <i>Lucioperca</i> of six to eight inches
in length the duct may be found still open for a considerable distance;
and, on the other hand, in adult <i>Physostomi</i>, that is Teleosteous
fishes with a ductus pneumaticus, not rarely the whole duct is found
very narrow, or, for some part of its length, even entirely closed.</p>

<p>Air-bladders without duct are found in Acanthopterygians,
Pharyngognaths, Anacanths, and Lophobranchs. They may consist of
a single cavity or divided by constrictions into two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span> or three
partitions situated behind one another; they may consist of two lateral
partitions, assuming a horseshoe-like form, or they may be a single
sac with a pair of simple or bifid processes in front or behind (Fig.
<a href="#fig61">61</a>). The families of <i>Sciænidæ</i> and <i>Polynemidæ</i> possess
air-bladders with a most extraordinary development of appendages
rising from each side of the air-bladder. In the Sciænoid (Fig. <a href="#fig63">63</a>)
fifty-two branches issue from each side, each branch being bifurcate
and bearing smaller appendages. In <i>Pogonias chromis</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig64">64</a>)
the sides of the anterior half is provided with irregular broad-fringed
appendages, the hindmost of which communicates by a narrow duct
with the posterior extremity of the air-bladder. In <i>Collichthys
lucida</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig62">62</a>) twenty-five appendages issue from each side; the
anterior ones are directed towards the front, but the lateral assume
a more posterior<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span> direction, the nearer they are to the posterior
extremity of the air-bladder, where they form an assemblage giving
the appearance of a cauda equina. All these appendages soon bifurcate
in a dorsal and ventral stem; these stems bifurcate again and again,
and either terminate after the first or second bifurcation or are so
far prolonged as to reach the median line of the ventral and dorsal
sides, anastomosing with the branches of the other side. The branches
being enveloped in laminæ of the peritonæum, form a dorsal and ventral
sac of beautiful appearance, caused by the regular arrangement of the
air-vessels. The dorsal sac is situated between the air-bladder and
the roof of the abdominal cavity without being attached to the latter.
The ventral sac receives within its cavity the intestine, liver, and
ovaries.—A peculiar mechanism has been observed in the air-bladder of
the <i>Ophidiidæ</i>, the anterior portion of which can be prolonged by
the contraction of two muscles attached to its anterior extremity, with
or without the addition of a small bone.</p>

<p>Air-bladders with a pneumatic duct are found in Ganoids and
Physostomes, the duct entering the dorsal side of the intestinal
tract, with the exception of <i>Polyp</i><i>terus</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span> and the
<i>Dipnoi</i>, in which it enters on the ventral side of the œsophagus.
In the majority the orifice is in the œsophagus, but in some, as in
<i>Acipenser</i>, in the cardiac portion of the stomach, or in its
blind sac, as in many Clupeoids. The air-bladder may be single, or
consist of two divisions situated one behind the other (Fig. <a href="#fig52">52</a>); its
inner surface may be perfectly smooth, or form manifold pouches and
cells. If two divisions are present the anterior possesses a middle
elastic membrane which is absent in the posterior; each division has
a muscular layer, by which it can be separately compressed, so that
part of the contents of the posterior may be driven into the elastic
anterior division, and <i>vice versa</i>. The posterior division being
provided with the ductus pneumaticus does not require the elasticity of
the anterior.</p>

  </div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span></p>

<p>Some Siluroids possess a peculiar apparatus for voluntarily exercising
a pressure upon the air-bladder. From the first vertebra a process
takes its origin on each side, expanding at its end into a large round
plate; this is applied to the side of the air-bladder, and by pressing
upon it expels the air through the duct; the small muscle moving the
plate rises from the skull.</p>

<p>The connection of the air-bladder with the organ of hearing in some
Physostomes has been described above, p. 117.</p>

<p>In the modifications of the air-bladder, hitherto mentioned, the
chief and most general function is a mechanical one; this organ
serves to regulate the specific gravity of the fish, to aid it in
maintaining a particular level in the water, in rising or sinking,
in raising or depressing the front part of its body as occasion may
serve. Yet a secretion of gas from the blood into its cavity must take
place; and if this be so, it is not at all impossible that also an
exchange of gases between the two kinds of blood is effected by means
of the extraordinary development of <i>retia mirabilia</i> in many
air-bladders.</p>

<p>In all fishes the arteries of the air-bladder take their origin from
the aorta or the system of the aorta, and its veins return either to
the portal, or vertebral, or hepatic veins; like the other organs of
the abdominal cavity it receives arterial blood and returns venous
blood. However, in many fishes the arteries as well as veins break
up below the inner membrane into <i>retia mirabilia</i> in various
ways. The terminal ramifications of the arteries may dissolve into
fan-like tufts of capillaries over almost every part of the inner
surface, as in Cyprinoids. Or these tufts of radiating capillaries
are more localised at various places, as in <i>Esocidæ</i>; or the
tufts are so aggregated as to form gland-like, <i>red bodies</i>, the
capillaries reuniting into larger vessels, which again ramify freely
round the border of the red body; the red bodies are formed not only
by minute arteries but also by minute veins, both freely anastomosing
with its kind, and being inextricably interwoven.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span> The rest of the
inner surface of the air-bladder receives its blood, not from the red
bodies, but from normally ramifying vessels. This kind of rete mirabile
or “vaso-ganglion” is found in the Perch and Gadoids; it is generally
distributed in closed air-bladders, but also sometimes observed in
air-bladders’ with pneumatic duct. In <i>Anguilla</i> and <i>Conger</i>
two similar vaso-ganglia are situated at the sides of the opening of
the pneumatic duct.</p>

<p>Whilst the air-bladders of some <i>Ganoids</i>, anatomically as well
as functionally, closely adhere to the Teleosteous type, that of
<i>Amia</i> is more cellular and lung-like in its interior than the
Teleosteous air-bladder, and <i>Polypterus</i> approaches the Dipnoi
not only in having a laterally divided air-bladder but also in its
pneumatic duct entering the <i>ventral</i> side of the œsophagus. The
air-bladder of the <i>Dipnoi</i> possesses still more the anatomical
characteristics of a lung and assumes its functions, though, as it
co-exists with gills, only periodically<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span> or in an auxiliary manner. The
ductus pneumaticus is a membranous bronchus, entering the ventral side
of the œsophagus, and provided at its entrance with a <i>glottis</i>.
In <i>Ceratodus</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig65">65</a>) the lung is still a single cavity, but
with a symmetrical arrangement of its internal pouches; it has no
pulmonal artery, but receives branches from the <i>arteria cœliaca</i>.
Finally, in <i>Lepidosiren</i> and <i>Protopterus</i> the lung is
completely divided into lateral halves, and by its cellular structure
approaches most nearly that of a reptile; it is supplied with venous
blood by a true pulmonary artery.</p>

<span class="subhed">ORGANS OF CIRCULATION.</span></h2></div>

<p>The <i>Blood-corpuscles</i> of fishes are, with one exception, of an
elliptic shape; this exception is <i>Petromyzon</i>, which possesses
circular, flat, or slightly biconvex blood-corpuscles. They vary
much in size; they are smallest in Teleosteans and Cyclostomes,
those of <i>Acerina cernua</i> measuring 1/2461 of an inch in their
longitudinal, and 1/3000 in their transverse diameter. As far as it is
known at present the <i>Salmonidæ</i> have the largest blood-corpuscles
among Teleosteans, those of the salmon measuring 1/1524 by 1/2460 in.,
approaching those of the Sturgeon. Those of the Chondropterygians are
still larger; and finally, <i>Lepidosiren</i> has blood-corpuscles
not much smaller than those of Perennibranchiates, viz.—1/570 by
1/941 in. Branchiostoma is the only fish which does not possess red
blood-corpuscles.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

</div>

<p>Fishes, in common with the other Vertebrates, are provided with a
complete circulation for the body, with another equally complete for
the organs of respiration, and with a particular abdominal circulation,
terminating at the liver by means of the <i>vena portæ</i>; but
their peculiar character consists in this, that the branchial
circulation alone is provided at its base with a muscular apparatus or
<i>heart</i>, corresponding to the right half of the heart of Mammalia
and Birds.</p>

<p>The <i>Heart</i> is situated between the branchial and abdominal
cavities, between the two halves of the scapulary arch,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span> rarely
farther behind, as in <i>Symbranchidæ</i>. It is enclosed in a
<i>pericardium</i>, generally entirely separated from the abdominal
cavity by a diaphragma, which is, in fact, the anterior portion of the
peritoneum, strengthened by aponeurotic fibres. However, in some fishes
there is a communication between the pericardial and peritoneal sacs,
viz. in the Chondropterygians and Acipenser, whilst in the Myxinoids
the pericardial sac is merely a continuation of the peritoneum.</p>

  </div>

<p>The heart is, relatively to the size of the body, very small, and
consists of three divisions: the <i>atrium</i>, with a large <i>sinus
venosus</i> into which the veins enter; the <i>ventricle</i>; and a
conical hollow swelling at the beginning of the arterial system, the
structure of which forms one of the most important characters used
in the classification of fishes. In all <i>Palæichthyes</i> (Figs.
<a href="#fig66">66</a> and <a href="#fig67">67</a>) this swelling is still a division of the pulsating heart,
being provided with a thick muscular stratum; it is not separated from
the ventricle by two valves opposite to each other, but its interior
is fitted with a plurality of valves, arranged in transverse series
more or less numerous in the various groups of <i>Palæichthyes</i>.
<i>Lepidosiren</i> and <i>Protopterus</i> offer an example of a
modification of this valvular arrangement, their valves being
longitudinal, each valve in fact being formed by the confluence of
several smaller ones situated behind one another. This Palæichthyan
type is called <i>conus arteriosus</i>.</p>

<p>In Cyclostomes and Teleosteans (Fig. <a href="#fig68">68</a>) the enlargement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span> is a swelling
of the artery, without muscular stratum and without contractility; with
the exception of the Myxinoids its walls are thick, fibrous, with many
trabeculæ and pouches, but it has no valves in its interior, and is
separated from the ventricle by two valves opposite to each other. This
Teleostean type is called <i>bulbus aortæ</i>.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="fig68" style="max-width: 251px">

  </div>

<p>The sinus venosus sends the whole of the venous blood by a single
orifice of its anterior convexity into the atrium; two thin membranous
valvules turned towards the atrium, prevent the blood from re-entering
the sinus. A pair of other valves between atrium and ventricle have the
same function. The walls of the ventricle are robust, and, internally,
it is furnished with powerful fleshy trabeculæ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span></p>

<p>The bulbus or conus arteriosus is prolonged into the branchial artery
which soon divides, sending off a branch to each branchial arch. On
returning from the respiratory organ the branchial veins assume the
structure and functions of arteries. Several branches are sent off
to different portions of the head and to the heart, but the main
trunks unite to form the great artery which carries the blood to the
viscera and all the parts of the trunk and tail, and which, therefore,
represents the <i>aorta</i> of higher animals.</p>

<p>In the majority of Teleosteans the <i>aorta</i> has proper walls formed
by its own membranes, but in the Sturgeons it is independent at its
commencement only, and replaced by a canal formed by hæmal elements of
the vertebral column, and clothed inside with a perichondrium. In many
Chondropterygians and some Teleosteans (<i>Esox</i>, <i>Clupea</i>,
<i>Silurus</i>), the aorta possesses its own firm membranes along its
ventral side, dorsally being protected by a very thin membrane only,
attached to the concavity of the centra of the vertebræ.</p>

<p>The circulatory system of <i>Branchiostoma</i> and of the <i>Dipnoi</i>
shows essential differences from that of other fishes.</p>

<p><i>Branchiostoma</i> is the only fish which does not possess a
muscular heart, several cardinal portions of its vascular system being
contractile. A great vein extends forwards along the caudal region
below the notochord, and exhibits contractility in a forward direction;
it is bent anteriorly, passing into another tube-like pulsatile trunk,
the branchial heart, which runs along the middle of the base of the
pharynx, sending off branches on each side to the branchiæ; each of
these branches has a small contractile dilatation (<i>bulbillus</i>) at
its base. The two anterior branches pass directly into the aorta, the
others are branchial arteries, the blood of which returns by branchial
veins emptying into the aorta. The blood of the intestinal veins is
collected in a contractile tube, the portal vein, situated below the
intestine, and distributed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span> over the rudimentary liver. Of all other
fishes, only in <i>Myxinoids</i> the portal vein is contractile. All
the blood-corpuscles of <i>Branchiostoma</i> are colourless and without
nucleus.</p>

<p>In <i>Dipnoi</i> a rudimentary division of the heart into a right and
left partition has been observed; this is limited to the ventricle in
<i>Ceratodus</i>, but in <i>Lepidosiren</i> and <i>Protopterus</i>
an incomplete septum has been observed in the atrium also. All
Dipnoi have a pulmonal vein, which enters the atrium by a separate
opening, provided with a valve. The pulmonal artery rises in
<i>Lepidosiren</i> and <i>Protopterus</i> from an arch of the aorta,
but in <i>Ceratodus</i> it is merely a subordinate branch, rising from
the <i>Arteria cœliaca</i>.</p>

<h2 class="smaller">CHAPTER XI.<br>
<span class="subhed">URINARY ORGANS.</span></h2></div>

<p>In <i>Branchiostoma</i> no urinary organs have been found.</p>

<p>In Myxinoids these organs are of a very primitive structure: they
consist of a pair of ducts, extending from the urogenital porus through
the abdominal cavity. Each duct sends off at regular intervals from
its outer side a short wide branch (the uriniferous tube), which
communicates by a narrow opening with a blind sac. At the bottom of
this sac there is a small vaso-ganglion (<i>Malpighian corpuscle</i>),
by which the urine is secreted.</p>

<p>In the Lampreys the kidneys form a continuous gland-like body, with
irregular detached small portions. The ureters coalesce before they
terminate in the urogenital papilla.</p>

<p>In Chondropterygians the kidneys occupy the posterior half or
two-thirds of the back of the abdominal cavity, without the sac of the
peritoneum (as in all fishes) which forms a firm tendinous horizontal
septum. The kidneys of the two sides are never confluent, and generally
show a convoluted or lobulated surface. The ureters are short; each is
dilated into a pouch, and communicating with its fellow terminates by a
single urethra (which also receives the vasa deferentia) behind the end
of the rectum in the large common cloaca.</p>

<p>In Ganoids the kidneys occupy a similar position as in
Chondropterygians, but these fishes differ considerably with regard
to the termination and the arrangement of the ends of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span> the urogenital
ducts. The Dipnoi possess a cloaca. In <i>Ceratodus</i> the ureters
open into it by a common opening, separate from the genital opening;
and no closed urinary bladder has been developed. <i>Lepidosiren</i>
has a small urinary bladder; the ureters do not communicate directly
with it, but terminate separately on small papillæ in the dorsal
compartment of the cloaca. The other Ganoids lack a cloaca, and the
urogenital opening is behind the vent as in Teleosteans. In all the
genital and urinary ducts coalesce towards their end. The Sturgeons
have no urinary bladder, whilst it is present in <i>Amia</i>, the
ureters opening separately into it.</p>

<p>The <i>kidneys</i> of Teleosteans are situated likewise without the
peritoneal cavity, immediately below some part of the vertebral column,
and vary exceedingly with regard to form and extent. Sometimes they
reach from the skull to between the muscles of the tail, sometimes
they are limited to the foremost part of the abdominal cavity (in
advance of the diaphragm), but generally their extent corresponds to
that of the abdominal portion of the vertebral column. Frequently
they are irregular on their dorsal surface, filling every available
recess, flat, attenuated on the sides, more or less coalescent
towards the middle; in other fishes they are more compact bodies. The
ureters terminate, either separate or united, in a urinary bladder,
varying in shape, which opens by a short urethra behind the vent. The
urinary opening may be separate or confluent with that of the genital
ducts, and is frequently placed on a more or less prominent papilla
(<i>papilla urogenitalis</i>). If separate, the urinary opening is
behind the genital; and if a papilla is developed, its extremity is
perforated by the urethra, the genital opening being situated nearer
the base. A few Teleosteans show an arrangement similar to that of
Chondropterygians and Dipnoi, the urogenital openings being in the
posterior wall of the rectum (<i>Symbranchidæ</i>, <i>Pediculati</i>,
and some <i>Plectognathi</i>).</p>

<h2 class="smaller">CHAPTER XII.<br>
<span class="subhed">ORGANS OF REPRODUCTION.</span></h2></div>

<p>All fishes are <i>dioecious</i>, or of distinct sex. Instances
of so-called <i>hermaphroditism</i> are, with the exception of
<i>Serranus</i>, abnormal individual peculiarities, and have been
observed in the Cod-fish, some Pleuronectidæ, and in the Herring.
Either the generative organ of one side was found to be male, that
of the other female; or the organ of one or both sides was observed
to have been developed partly into an ovary partly into a testicle.
In the European species of Serranus a testicle-like body is attached
to the lower part of the ovary; but many specimens of this genus are
undoubtedly males, having normally developed testicles only.</p>

<p>The majority of fishes are oviparous, comparatively few viviparous;
the embryos being developed either in the ovarium or in some dilated
portion of the oviduct. In viviparous fishes actual copulation takes
place, and the males of most of them are provided with copulatory
or intromittent organs. In oviparous fishes the generative products
are, during sexual excitement, discharged into the water, a very
small quantity of semen being sufficient for effectual impregnation
of a number of ova dispersed in a considerable quantity of water;
circumstances which render <i>artificial impregnation</i> more
practicable than in any other class of animals.</p>

<p>In <i>Branchiostoma</i> the generative organs occupy the ventral side
of the abdominal cavity, into which they discharge their contents. No
ducts are developed in either sex.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span></p>

<p>In the <i>Cyclostomes</i> the generative organ is single, and fixed to
or suspended from the median line of the back of the visceral cavity
by a duplicature of the peritoneum (<i>mesoarium</i>); the testicle
and ovary being distinguishable by their contents only. These escape
by dehiscence of the cells or capsules and rupture of the peritoneal
covering into the abdominal cavity, and are expelled by reciprocal
pressure of the intertwined sexes through the <i>porus genitalis</i>,
which is sunk between two labia of the skin in <i>Myxine</i>, and
produced into a long papilla in Petromyzon.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="fig69" style="max-width: 250px">

     alt="">
     <p class="p0 center smaller">69.—Ovum of Myxine glutinosa, enlarged.</p>
  </div>

<p>The ova of the Lampreys are small, globular, like those of Teleosteans.
Those of Myxine have a very peculiar shape when mature; they are of an
oval form, about 15 millimetres long and 8 millimetres broad, enveloped
in a horny case, which at each end is provided with a bundle of short
threads, each thread ending in a triple hook. Whilst in the mesoarial
fold the eggs are attached to one another by means of these hooks, and
after being expelled they probably fix themselves by the same means to
other objects. As in all fishes producing ova of large size, the number
of ova matured in one season is but small.</p>

<p>In <i>Teleosteans</i> the generative organs are comparatively
large. In some families the ovaries are without closed covering
and without oviducts, as in <i>Salmonidæ</i>, <i>Galaxiidæ</i>,
<i>Notopteridæ</i>, <i>Murænidæ</i>, and others. The surface of such
an open ovary—as, for instance, that of the Salmon—is transversely
plaited, the ova being developed in capsules in the stroma of the
laminæ; after rupture of the capsules the mature ova drop into the
abdominal cavity, and are expelled by the porus genitalis. The ovaries
of the other Teleosteans are closed sacs, continued into oviducts.
Frequently such ovaries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span> coalesce into a single body, or one in which
the division is effected internally only by a more or less complete
septum. Fixed by a mesoarium, the ovaries occupy generally a position
outwards of the intestine or air-bladder; their form varies as well
as the thickness and firmness of their covering, which frequently
is an extremely thin transparent membrane. The inner surface of the
ovarian sac is transversely or longitudinally plaited or covered with
fringes, on which the ova are developed, as in the open ovaries. In
the viviparous Teleosteans the embryons are likewise developed within
the ovary, notably in the <i>Embiotocidæ</i>, many <i>Blenniidæ</i>,
and <i>Cyprinodontidæ</i>, <i>Sebastes viviparus</i>, etc. Among
the Cyprinodonts the end of the oviduct is attached to the anterior
anal rays, which are modified into supports of its termination. In
<i>Rhodeus</i> the oviduct is periodically prolonged into a long
oviferous tube, by means of which the female deposits her ova into the
shells of living Bivalves.</p>

  </div>

<p>The <i>ova</i> of Teleosteous Fishes are extremely variable in size,
quite independently of the size of the parent species. The ova of large
and small individuals of the same species, of course, do not differ in
size; but, on the whole larger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span> individuals produce a greater number
of ova than smaller ones of the same species. The larger the size of
the ova is in a species, the smaller is the number produced during one
season. The ova of the Eel are almost microscopic. The small sized roe
in the Herring, Lump-fish, Halibut, and Cod-fish, have been estimated
at respectively 25,000, 155,000, 3,500,000, and 9,344,000. Larger in
size and fewer in number are those of <i>Antennarius</i>, <i>Salmo</i>,
<i>Aspredo</i>, <i>Lophobranchs</i>, etc. Comparatively largest are
those of <i>Gastrosteus</i>; and the Siluroid genus <i>Arius</i>, the
males of which take care of their progeny, produces ova from 5 to 10
millimeters in diameter. The ova of all Teleosteans are perfectly
globular and soft-shelled. Teleosteans without oviduct, deposit them
separated from one another; whilst in many Teleosteans with an oviduct
the ova are enveloped in a glutinous substance, secreted by its glands,
swelling in the water and forming lumps or cords, in which the ova are
aggregated.</p>

  </div>

<p>Instances of the female taking care of her progeny are extremely scarce
in fishes. At present only two examples are known, that of the Siluroid
genus <i>Aspredo</i>, and of <i>Solenostoma</i>. In the former, during
the time of propagation, the integuments of the lower side of the flat
trunk of the female assume a soft and spongy texture. After having
deposited the eggs, the female attaches them to, and presses them into,
the spongy integument, by merely lying over them. She carries them on
her belly, as the Surinam Toad (<i>Pipa</i>) carries her ova on the
back. When the eggs are hatched the excrescence on the skin disappears,
and the abdomen becomes as smooth as before. In <i>Solenostoma</i>
the inner side of the long and broad ventral fins coalesces with the
integuments of the body, a large pouch being formed for the reception
of the eggs. There is a peculiar provision for the retention of the
eggs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span> in the sac, and probably for the attachment of the embryo. The
inner walls of the sac are lined with long filaments,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span> arranged in
series along the ventral rays, and more numerous and longer at the
base of the rays than in the middle of their length, behind which they
disappear entirely. They are also more developed in examples in which
eggs are deposited in the sac than in those which have the sac empty.
The filaments most developed have a length of half an inch, and are
beset with mamilliform appendages. A slightly undulated canal runs
along the interior of the filament.</p>

<p>The <i>Testicles</i> of the <i>Teleosteans</i> are always paired,
and occupy the same position as the ovaries. Their size varies
extraordinarily at the different seasons of the year. Vasa deferentia
are constant. In the males of viviparous Teleosteans the urogenital
papilla is frequently enlarged, and clearly serves as an intromittent
organ. In <i>Clinus despicillatus</i> the vas deferens widens
within the abdomen into a cavity occupied by a complex network of
loose fasciculi, rising from the mucous membrane. The cavity can be
compressed by a special powerful muscle, the accumulated semen being
thus expelled with considerable force through the narrow aperture
of the penis. In many Cyprinodonts the vas deferens runs along the
anterior anal rays, which may be thickened, and prolonged into a long
slender organ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span></p>

<p>Many Teleostei take care of their progeny, but with the exception of
<i>Aspredo</i> and <i>Solenostoma</i>, mentioned above (p. 160), it is
the male on which this duty devolves. In some, as in <i>Cottus</i>,
<i>Gastrosteus</i>, <i>Cyclopterus</i>, <i>Antennarius</i>,
<i>Ophiocephalus</i>, <i>Callichthys</i>, the male constructs with
more or less skill a nest, and jealously guards the ova deposited in
it by the female. The male of some species of <i>Arius</i> carries the
ova (Fig. <a href="#fig71">71</a>) about with him in his capacious pharynx. The species of
<i>Chromis</i>, inhabiting the sea of Galilee, are said to take care
of their ova in the same manner. And, finally, in the Lophobranchs,
nature has aided this instinct by the development of a pouch on the
abdomen or lower side of the tail. In the Syngnathidæ this pouch is
formed by a fold of the skin developed from each side of the trunk and
tail, the free margins of the fold being firmly united in the median
line, whilst the eggs are being hatched in the inside of the pouch.
In <i>Hippocampus</i> the pouch is completely closed, with a narrow
anterior opening.</p>

<p>The genital organs of <i>Ganoids</i> show similar diversity of
structure as those of Teleosteans, but on the whole they approach<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
the Batrachian type. The ovaries are not closed, except in
<i>Lepidosiren</i>; all Ganoids possess oviducts. In the Sturgeons the
oviduct as well as the vas deferens is represented by a funnel-shaped
prolongation of the peritoneum, which communicates with the wide
ureter. The inner aperture of the funnel is on a level of the middle
of the testicle or ovary, the outer within the ureter; and it is a
noteworthy fact that only at certain periods of the life of the fish
this outer aperture is found to be open,—at other times the peritoneal
funnel appears as a closed blind sac within the ureter. The mode of
passage of the semen into the funnel is not known.</p>

<p>In <i>Polypterus</i> and <i>Amia</i>, proper oviducts, with abdominal
apertures in about the middle of the abdominal cavity, are developed;
they coalesce with the ureters close to the common urogenital aperture.</p>

<p>In <i>Ceratodus</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig77">77</a>), a long convoluted oviduct extends to
the foremost limit of the abdominal cavity, where it opens by a slit
at a considerable distance from the front end of the long ovary;
this aperture is closed in sexually immature specimens. The oviducts
unite close to their common opening in the cloaca. During their
passage through the oviduct the ova receive a gelatinous covering
secreted by its mucous membrane. This is probably also the case
in <i>Lepidosiren</i>, which possesses a convoluted oviduct with
secretory glands in the middle of its length. The oviduct begins with
a funnel-shaped dilatation, and terminates in a wide pouch, which
posteriorly communicates with that of the other side, both opening by a
common aperture behind the urinary bladder.</p>

<p>The ova of Ganoids, as far as they are known at present, are small, but
enveloped in a gelatinous substance. In the Sturgeon have been counted
as many as 7,635,200. Those of <i>Lepidosteus</i> seem to be the
largest, measuring 5 millimetres in diameter with their envelope, and 3
millimetres without it. They are deposited singly, like those of Newts.</p>

<p>In <i>Chondropterygians</i> (and <i>Holocephali</i>) the organs of
reproduction assume a more compact form, and are more free from
a lengthened attachment to the back of the abdominal cavity. The
ovaries of the majority are paired, single in the <i>Carchariidæ</i>
and <i>Scylliidæ</i>, one remaining undeveloped. But the oviducts
are always paired, beginning immediately behind the diaphragma with
a common aperture. They consist of two divisions, separated by a
circular valve; the upper is narrow, and provided within its coats
with a gland which secretes the leathery envelope in which most of
the Chondropterygian ova are enclosed; the lower forms the uterine
dilatation, in which the embryoes of the viviparous species are
developed. Generally the vitelline sac of the embryoes is free, and
without connection with the uterus, which in these cases has merely the
function of a protecting pouch; but in Carcharias and Mustelus lævis a
<i>placenta uterina</i> is formed, the vascular walls of the vitelline
sac forming plaits fitting into those of the membrane of the uterus.
The ends of the uteri open by a common aperture behind the ureter into
the cloaca.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span></p>

<p>The testicles are always paired, rounded, and situated in the
anterior part of the abdominal cavity, covered by the liver. <i>Vasa
efferentia</i> pass the semen into a much-convoluted <i>epididymis</i>,
which is continued into the <i>vas deferens</i>; this, at the
commencement of its course, is spirally wound, but becomes straight
behind, and has its end dilated into a seminal reservoir. It opens with
the urethra in a papilla within the cloaca.</p>

<p>The so-called <i>claspers</i> of Chondropterygians (Fig. <a href="#fig78">78</a>) are
characteristic of all male individuals. They are semi-ossified
appendages of the pubic, with which they are movably joined, and
special muscles serve to regulate their movements. Sometimes they are
armed with hook-like osseous excrescences (<i>Selache</i>). They are
irregularly longitudinally convoluted, and, when closely ad-pressed to
each other, form a canal open at their extremity. A gland, abundantly
discharging a secretion during the season of propagation, is situated
at, and opens into, the base of the canal. It is still doubtful whether
the generally-adopted opinion that their function consists in holding
the female during copulation is correct, or whether they are not
rather an intromittent organ, the canal of which not only conducts the
secretion of their proper gland but also the impregnating fluid.</p>

<p>The ova of the oviparous Chondropterygians are large and few in number;
they are successively impregnated,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span> and the impregnation must take
place before they are invested with a tough leathery envelope which
would be impenetrable to the semen, that is, before they enter the
uterus; therefore, copulation must take place in all these fishes. The
form of the egg-shell differs in the various genera; generally (Fig.
<a href="#fig79">79</a>) they are flattened, quadrangular, with each of the four corners
produced, and frequently prolonged into long filaments which serve for
the attachment of the ova to other fixed objects. In <i>Notidanus</i>
the surfaces are crossed by numerous ridges. In <i>Cestracion</i>
(Fig. <a href="#fig80">80</a>) the egg is pyriform, with two broad ridges or plates, wound
edgewise round it, the two ridges forming five spires. The eggs of
<i>Callorhynchus</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span> (Fig. <a href="#fig81">81</a>) have received a protective resemblance

<span class="subhed">GROWTH AND VARIATION OF FISHES.</span></h2></div>

<p>Changes of form normally accompanying growth (after absorption of
the vitelline sac) are observed in all fishes; but in the majority
they affect only the proportional size of the various parts of the
body. In young fishes the eyes are constantly larger than in adult
relatively to the size of the head; and again, the head is larger
relatively to that of the body. Changes amounting to metamorphosis
have been hitherto observed in <i>Petromyzon</i> only. In the larval
condition (<i>Ammocætes</i>) the head is very small, and the toothless
buccal cavity is surrounded by a semicircular upper lip. The eyes are
extremely small, hidden in a shallow groove; and the vertical fins
form a continuous fringe. In the course of three or four years the
teeth are developed, and the mouth changes into a perfect suctorial
organ; the eyes grow; and the dorsal fin is divided into two divisions.
In Malacopterygians and Anacanths the embryonal fringe from which
the vertical fins are developed, is much longer persistent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span> than in
Acanthopterygians. A metamorphosis relating to the respiratory organs,
as in Batrachians, is indicated in the class of Fishes by the external
gills with which fœtal Plagiostomes (Fig. <a href="#fig58">58</a>, p. 136) and the young of
some Ganoids, viz. the <i>Protopterus</i> and <i>Polypterus</i>, are
provided.</p>

  </div>

<p>One of the most extraordinary changes by which, during growth, the
form and position of several important organs are affected, occurs
in Flat-fishes (<i>Pleuronectidæ</i>); their young are symmetrically
formed, with a symmetrical mouth, and with one eye on each side, and,
therefore, keep their body in a vertical position when swimming. As
they grow they live more on the bottom, and their body, during rest,
assumes a horizontal position; in consequence, the eye of the lower
side moves towards the upper, which alone is coloured; and in many
genera the mouth is twisted in the opposite direction, so that the
bones, muscles, and teeth are much more developed on the blind side
than on the coloured. In a great number of other <i>Teleostei</i>
certain bones of the head show a very different form in the young
state. Ossification proceeds in those bones in the direction of lines
or radii which project in the form of spines or processes; as the
interspaces between these processes are filled with bone, the processes
disappear entirely, or at least project much less in the older than
in the younger individuals (Fig. <a href="#fig84">84</a>). The young of some fishes may be
armed with a long powerful præopercular or scapular spine, or show
a serrature of which nothing remains in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span> adult fish except some
ridges or radiating lines. These processes seem to serve as weapons
of defence during a period in the life of the fish in which it needs
them most. In not a few instances a portion of this armature is so
much developed that the disappearance of its most projecting parts
with the growth of the fish is not only due to its being surrounded
by other bone, but, partially at least, caused by absorption. The
<i>Carangidæ</i>, <i>Cyttidæ</i>, <i>Squamipinnes</i>, <i>Xiphiidæ</i>,
offer instances of such remarkable changes. A fish, described as
<i>Tholichthys osseus</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig85">85</a>), is probably the young of a
Cyttoid, the suprascapula, humerus, and præoperculum forming enormously
enlarged plates. In the fish Fig. <a href="#fig86">86</a> those bones appear still enlarged,
and the frontals develop a remarkably long and curved horn above the
orbit. In the <i>Tholichthys</i>-stage of <i>Pomacanthus</i> (specimens
10 millimetres long, Fig. <a href="#fig87">87</a>), the frontal bone is prolonged into a
straight lancet-shaped process, nearly half as long as the body; the
suprascapular and præopercular processes cover<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span> and hide the dorsal
and ventral fins. The plates attached to the shoulder-girdle remain
persistent until the young fish has assumed the form of the adult;
thus they are still visible in young <i>Chætodon citrinellus</i>, 30
millimetres long, in which the specific characters are already fully
developed.—The Sword-fishes with ventral fins (<i>Histiophorus</i>)
belong to the Teleosteans of the largest size; in young individuals,
9 millimetres long (Fig. <a href="#fig89">89</a>), both jaws are produced, and armed with
pointed teeth; the supraorbital margin is ciliated; the parietal and
præoperculum are prolonged into long spines; the dorsal and anal fins
are a low fringe, and the ventrals make their appearance as a pair
of short buds. When 14 millimetres long (Fig. <a href="#fig90">90</a>) the young fish has
still the same armature of the head, but the dorsal fin has become much
higher, and the ventral<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span> filaments have grown to a great length. At a
third stage, when the fish has attained to a length of 60 millimetres,
the upper jaw is considerably prolonged beyond the lower,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span> losing its
teeth; the spines of the head are shortened, and the fins assume nearly
the shape which they retain in mature individuals. Young Sword-fishes
without ventral fins (<i>Xiphias</i>) undergo similar changes;
and, besides, their skin is covered with small rough excrescences
longitudinally arranged, which continue to be visible after the young
fish has assumed the form of the mature in other respects (Fig. <a href="#fig92">92</a>).</p>

<p>The Plectognaths show no less extraordinary changes: an extraordinary
form taken in the South Atlantic, and named <i>Ostracion
boops</i>, is considered by Lütken to be the young of a Sun-fish
(<i>Orthagoriscus</i>). In very young more advanced Sun-fishes (18
to 32 millimetres) the vertical diameter of the body exceeds, or is
not much less than, the longitudinal; and small conical spines are
scattered over its various parts. The caudal fin is developed long
after the other vertical fins.</p>

  </div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span></p>

<p>Similar changes take place in a number of other fishes, and in many
cases the young are so different that they were described as distinct
genera: thus <i>Priacantichthys</i> has proved to be the young of
<i>Serranus</i>, <i>Rhynchichthys</i> that of <i>Holocentrum</i>,
<i>Cephalacanthus</i> of <i>Dactylopterus</i>, <i>Dicrotus</i>
of <i>Thyrsites</i>, <i>Nauclerus</i> of <i>Naucrates</i>,
<i>Porthmeus</i> of <i>Chorinemus</i>, <i>Lampugus</i> of
<i>Coryphæna</i>, <i>Acronurus</i> of <i>Acanthurus</i>, <i>Keris</i>
of <i>Naseus</i>, <i>Porobronchus</i> of <i>Fierasfer</i>,
<i>Couchia</i> of <i>Motella</i>, <i>Stomiasunculus</i> of
<i>Stomias</i>, etc.</p>

<p>The fins are most frequently subject to changes; but, whilst in some
fishes parts of them are prolonged into filaments with age, in others
the filaments exist during the early life-periods only; whilst in some
a part of the dorsal or the ventral fins is normally developed in the
young only, in others those very parts are peculiar to the mature age.
The integuments are similarly altered: in some species the young only
has asperities on the skin, in others the young are smooth and the old
have a tubercular skin; in some the young only have a hard bony head;
in others (some Siluroids) the osseous carapace of the head and neck,
as it appears in the adult, is more or less covered with soft skin
whilst the fish is young.</p>

<p>In not a few fishes the external changes are in relation to the
sexual development (<i>Callionymus</i>, many <i>Labyrinthici</i>,
Cyprinodonts). These <i>secondary sexual differences</i> show
themselves in the male individual, only when it commences to enter upon
his sexual functions, and it may require two or more seasons before
its external characteristics are fully developed. Immature males do
not differ externally from the old female. The male secondary sexual
characters consist principally in the prolongation of some of the
fin-rays, or of entire fins; and in <i>Salmonidæ</i> in the greater
development of the jaw-bones. The coloration of the male is in many
fishes much brighter and more variegated than that of the female,
but in comparatively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span> few permanent (as in some <i>Callionymus</i>,
<i>Labrus mixtus</i>); generally it is acquired immediately before and
during the season of propagation only, and lost afterwards. Another
periodical change in the integuments, also due to sexual influence and
peculiar to the male, is the excrescence of wart-like tubercles on the
skin of many <i>Cyprinoids</i>; they are developed chiefly on the head,
but sometimes extend over the whole body and all the fins.</p>

<p>With regard to size, it appears that in all Teleosteous fishes the
female is larger than the male; in many Cyprinodonts the male may be
only one-sixth or even less of the bulk of the female. The observations
on the relative size of the sexes are few in Palæichthyes, but such
as have been made tend to show that, if a difference exists at all,
the male is generally the larger (<i>Lepidosteus</i>). In the Rays
(<i>Raja</i>) the sexes, after they have attained maturity, differ in
the development of dermal spines and the form of the teeth, the female
being frequently much rougher than the male. There is much variation
in this respect in the different species; but the males are constantly
distinguished by an oblong patch of erectile claw-like spines on each
pectoral fin, and by having the teeth (all, or only a portion) pointed,
and not obtuse, like those of the females. In Sharks no secondary
sexual differences have been observed; the male <i>Chimæridæ</i> (see
Fig. <a href="#fig96">96</a>, p. 184), possess a singular comb-like cartilaginous appendage
on the top of the head, which can be erected or depressed into a
groove, both the appendage and the anterior part of the groove being
armed with hooklets. The use of this singular organ is not known.</p>

<p>The majority of Teleostei are <i>mixogamous</i>—that is, the males and
females congregate on the spawning-beds, and the number of the former
being in excess, several males attend to the same female, frequently
changing from one female to another. The same habit has been observed
in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span> <i>Lepidosteus</i>. <i>Gastrosteus</i> is truly polygamous,
several females depositing their ova into the same nest, guarded by
one male only. Some Teleostei (<i>Ophiocephalus</i>), and probably
all Chondropterygians, are monogamous; and it is asserted that the
connection between the pair is not merely temporary, but lasts until
they are separated by accident. Monogamous are probably also all those
Teleosteans which bring forth living young, and those, the males of
which, for the attraction of the female, are provided with appendages,
or ornamented with a bright coloration.</p>

<p><i>Hybridism</i> is another source of changes and variations within the
limits of a species, and is by no means so scarce as has been believed
hitherto; it is only apparently of exceptional occurrence, because
the life of fishes is more withdrawn from our direct observation
than that of terrestrial animals. It has been observed among
species of <i>Serranus</i>, <i>Pleuronectidæ</i>, <i>Cyprinidæ</i>,
<i>Clupeidæ</i>, and especially <i>Salmonidæ</i>. As in other animals,
the more certain kinds of fishes are brought under domestication,
the more readily do they interbreed with other allied species. It is
characteristic of hybrids that their characters are very variable,
the degrees of affinity to one or the other of the parents being
inconstant; and as these hybrids are known readily to breed with either
of the parent race, the variations of form, structure, and colour
are infinite. Of internal organs the dentition, gill-rakers, pyloric
appendages, are those particularly affected by such mixture of species.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Some fishes are known to grow rapidly (in the course of from one to
three years) and regularly to a certain size, growth being definitely
arrested after the standard has been attained. Such fishes may be
called “full-grown,” in the sense in which the term is applied to
warm-blooded Vertebrates—the Sticklebacks, most Cyprinodonts, and many
Clupeoids (Herring,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span> Sprat, Pilchard) are examples of this regular
kind of growth.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> But in the majority of fishes the rate of growth
is extremely irregular, and it is hardly possible to know when growth
is actually and definitely arrested. All seems to depend on the amount
of food and the more or less favourable circumstances under which the
individual grows up. Fishes which rapidly grow to a definite size are
short-lived, whilst those which steadily and slowly increase in size
attain to a great age, Teleosteans as well as Chondropterygians. Carp
and Pike have been ascertained to live beyond a hundred years.</p>

<p>It is evident that such diversity and irregularity of growth in
the same species is accompanied by considerable differences in the
appearance and general development of the fish. No instance is more
remarkable than that of the so-called <i>Leptocephali</i>, which for a
long time have been regarded either as a distinct group of Fishes, or
as the larval stages of various genera of fishes.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="fig95" style="max-width: 498px">

    class="p1"   
    src="images/fig95.jpg"
     alt="">
     <p class="p0 center smaller">Fig. 95.—Leptocephalus.</p>
  </div>

<p>The <i>Leptocephali</i> proper are small, narrow, elongate, more or
less band-shaped fishes, pellucid in a fresh state, but assuming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span> a
white colour when preserved in spirits, resembling a tapeworm, being
quite as soft and flexible. The skeleton is entirely cartilaginous, or
slight ossifications are only now and then visible, especially towards
the end of the vertebral column. The latter is replaced by a chorda
dorsalis which, in many specimens, is found to be divided into numerous
segments. Neural arches are sometimes present in their rudimentary
condition. The anterior end of the chorda passes into the cartilaginous
base of the skull, the connection not being by means of joint and
ligaments. Hæmal arches are found on the caudal portion. Ribs none. The
skull, like the vertebral column, is nearly entirely cartilaginous.
The basisphenoid, frontal, and jaw-bones are the first which may be
distinguished, and the mandible has generally ossifications.</p>

<p>The muscles are generally not attached to the chorda, which is
surrounded by a thick gelatinous mass, separating the lateral sets of
muscles from each other. These muscles are attached to the external
integument, each forming a thin flat angular band, the angle being
directed forwards. However, specimens are frequently found in which the
muscles are more developed, evidently at the expense of the gelatinous
matter, which is diminished in quantity. They are attached to the
chorda, and the entire fish has a more cylindrical form of the body
(<i>Helmichthys</i>).</p>

<p>The nervous, circulatory, and respiratory organs are well developed.
In those with a sub-cylindrical body the blood is red, in those with
a flat body the blood-corpuscles show but rarely a faint coloration.
There are four branchial arches, and in some (<i>Tilurus</i>)
pseudobrauchiæ have been found. The gill-openings are more or less
narrow. The nostrils are double on each side, and the posterior is
close to the eye.</p>

<p>The stomach has a large blind sac, and in <i>Leptocephalus</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span> two
lateral cæca. The intestine is straight, running close to the abdominal
profile, with a small appendix directed forward and a larger one
directed backwards. The vent is nearly always very small, and, in
preserved examples at least, cannot always be discovered. Its position
is variable, even in examples entirely similar in other points.
Air-bladder none. No trace of generative organs.</p>

<p>The vertical fins, when present, are confluent, with more or less
conspicuous traces of rays; sometimes they are merely a fold of the
skin, without any rays. Pectoral fins sometimes present, sometimes
rudimentary, sometimes entirely absent. Ventrals none.</p>

<p>Most examples have series of round black dots along each side of
the abdominal profile, along the lateral line, and sometimes along
the dorsal fin. They remind us of the luminous organs of many
<i>Scopelidæ</i>, <i>Stomiatidæ</i>, and other pelagic fishes, but are
composed entirely of pigmentary cells.</p>

<p>These fishes are found floating in the sea, frequently at a great
distance from land. Their movements are slow and languid. The largest
specimen of Leptocephalus observed was 10 inches, but specimens of that
size are very rare.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[See Kölliker, Zeitschr. wiss. Zool. iv. 1852, p. 360; and
Carus, Ueber die Leptocephaliden. Leipz. 1861. 4to.]</p>
</div>

<p>Taking into account all the various facts mentioned, we must come to
the conclusion that the Leptocephalids are the offspring of various
kinds of marine fishes, representing, not a normal stage of development
(larvæ), but an arrest of development at a very early period of their
life; they continue to grow to a certain size without corresponding
development of their internal organs, and perish without having
attained the characters of the perfect animal. The cause by which this
abnormal condition is brought about is not known; but it is quite
within the limits of probability that fishes usually spawning in the
vicinity of land sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span> spawn in the open ocean, or that floating
spawn is carried by currents to a great distance from land; and that
such embryoes, which for their normal growth require the conditions
afforded by the vicinity of the shore, if hatched in mid-ocean, grow
into undeveloped hydropic creatures, such as the Leptocephales seem to
be.</p>

<p>Abundance or scarcity of food, and other circumstances connected
with the localities inhabited by fishes, affect considerably the
colour of their muscles and integuments; the periodical changes of
colour in connection with their sexual functions have been referred
to above (p. 176). The flesh of many Teleostei is colourless, or but
slightly tinged by the blood; that of Scombridæ, most Ganoids and
Chondropterygians, is more or less red; but in badly-fed fishes, as
well as in very young ones, the flesh is invariably white (anæmic).
Many fishes, like the <i>Salmonidæ</i>, feed at times exclusively on
Crustaceans, and the colouring substance of these Invertebrates, which
by boiling and by the stomachic secretion turns red, seems to pass
into the flesh of the fishes, imparting to it the well-known “salmon”
colour. Further, the coloration of the integuments of many marine
fish is dependent on the nature of their surroundings. In those which
habitually hide themselves on the bottom, in sand, between stones or
seaweeds, the colours of the body readily assimilate to those of the
vicinity, and are thus an important element in the economy of their
life. The changes from one set or tinge of colours to another may be
rapid and temporary, or more or less permanent; in some fishes—as
in the Pediculati, of which the Sea-Devil, or <i>Lophius</i>, and
<i>Antennarius</i> are members—scarcely two individuals are found
exactly alike in coloration, and only too frequently such differences
in coloration are mistaken for specific characters. The changes of
colours are produced in two ways: either by an increase or decrease of
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span> black, red, yellow, etc., pigment-cells, or <i>chromatophors</i>,
in the skin of the fish; or by the rapid contraction or expansion of
the chromatophors which happen to be developed. The former change
is gradual, like every kind of growth or development; the latter
rapid, owing to the great sensitiveness of the cells, but certainly
involuntary. In many bright-shining fishes—as Mackerels, Mullets—the
colours appear to be brightest in the time intervening between the
capture of the fish and its death: a phenomenon clearly due to the
pressure of the convulsively-contracted muscles on the chromatophors.
External irritation readily excites the chromatophors to expand—a
fact unconsciously utilised by fishermen, who, by scaling the Red
Mullet immediately before its death, produce the desired intensity
of the red colour of the skin, without which the fish would not be
saleable. However, it does not require such strong measures to prove
the sensitiveness of the chromatophors to external irritation, the mere
change of darkness into light is sufficient to induce them to contract,
the fish appearing paler, and <i>vice versa</i>. In Trout which are
kept or live in dark places, the black chromatophors are expanded, and,
consequently, such specimens are very dark-coloured; when removed to
the light they become paler almost instantaneously.</p>

<p>Total absence of chromatophors in the skin, or <i>Albinism</i>, is very
rare among fishes; much more common is <i>incipient Albinism</i>, in
which the dark chromatophors are changed into cells with a more or less
intense yellow pigment. Fishes in a state of domestication, like the
Crucian Carp of China, the Carp, Tench, and the Ide, are particularly
subject to this abnormal coloration, and are known as the common
Gold-fish, the Gold-Tench, and the Gold-Orfe. But it occurs also not
rarely in fishes living in a wild state, and has been observed in the
Haddock, Flounder, Plaice, Carp, Roach, and Eel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span></p>

<p>It will be evident, from the foregoing remarks, that the amount of
variation within the limits of the same species—either due to the
natural growth and development, or to external physical conditions,
or to abnormal accidental circumstances—is greater in fishes than
in any of the higher classes of Vertebrates. The amount of variation
is greater in certain genera or families than in others, and it is
much greater in Teleosteans and Ganoids than in Chondropterygians.
Naturally, it is greatest in the few species which have been
domesticated, and which we shall mention in the succeeding chapter.</p>

<span class="subhed">DOMESTICATED AND ACCLIMATISED FISHES; ARTIFICIAL IMPREGNATION
OF OVA—TENACITY OF LIFE AND REPRODUCTION OF LOST
PARTS—HYBERNATION—USEFUL AND POISONOUS FISHES.</span></h2></div>

<p>A few fishes only are thoroughly domesticated—that is, bred in
captivity, and capable of transportation within certain climatic
limits—viz. the Carp, Crucian Carp (European and Chinese varieties),
Tench, Orfe or Ide, and the Goramy. The two former have accompanied
civilised man almost to every place of the globe where he has effected
a permanent settlement.</p>

<p>Attempts to acclimatise particularly useful species in countries in
which they were not indigenous have been made from time to time, but
were permanently successful in a few instances only; the failures
being due partly to the choice of a species which did not yield the
profitable return expected, partly to the utter disregard of the
difference of the climatic and other physical conditions between the
original and new homes of the fish. The first successful attempts of
acclimatisation were made with domestic species, viz. the Carp and
Gold-fish, which were transferred from Eastern Asia to Europe. Then,
in the first third of the present century, the Javanese Goramy was
acclimatised in Mauritius and Guiana, but no care seems to have been
taken to insure permanent advantages from the successful execution
of the experiment. In these cases fully developed individuals were
transported to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span> the country in which they were to be acclimatised. The
most successful attempt of recent years is the acclimatisation of the
Trout and Sea-Trout, and probably also of the Salmon, in Tasmania and
New Zealand, and of the Californian Salmon (<i>Salmo quinnat</i>?),
in Victoria, by means of artificially-impregnated ova. The ova were
transported on ice, in order to retard their development generally,
and thus to preserve them from destruction during the passage of the
tropical zone.</p>

<p><i>Artificial impregnation</i> of fish-ova was first practised by
<span class="smcap">J. L. Jacobi</span>, a native of Westphalia, in the years 1757–63,
who employed exactly the same method which is followed now; and there
is no doubt that this able observer of nature conceived and carried
out his idea with the distinct object of advantageously restocking
water-courses which had become unproductive, and increasing production
by fecundating and preserving all ova, of which a great proportion,
in the ordinary course of propagation, would be left unfecundated
or accidentally perish. Physiology soon turned to account Jacobi’s
discovery, and artificial impregnation has proved to be one of the
greatest helps to the student of embryology.</p>

<p>Fishes differ in an extraordinary degree with regard to tenacity of
life. Some will bear suspension of respiration—caused by removal from
water, or by exposure to cold or heat—for a long time, whilst others
succumb at once. Nearly all marine fishes are very sensitive to changes
in the temperature of the water, and will not bear transportation from
one climate to another. This seems to be much less the case with some
freshwater fishes of the temperate zones: the Carp may survive after
being frozen in a solid block of ice, and will thrive in the southern
parts of the temperate zone. On the other hand, some freshwater
fishes are so sensitive to a change in the water that they perish
when transplanted from their native river into another apparently
offering the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span> same physical conditions (Grayling, <i>Salmo hucho</i>).
Some marine fishes may be abruptly transferred from salt into fresh
water, like Sticklebacks, some Blennies, and <i>Cottus</i>, etc.;
others survive the change when gradually effected, as many migratory
fishes; whilst again, others cannot bear the least alteration in the
composition of the salt water (all pelagic fishes). On the whole,
instances of marine fishes voluntarily entering brackish or fresh water
are very numerous, whilst freshwater fishes proper but rarely descend
into salt water.</p>

<p>Abstinence from food affects different fishes in a similarly different
degree. Marine fishes can endure hunger less than freshwater fishes,
at least in the temperate zones, no observations having been made in
this respect on tropical fishes. Goldfishes, Carps, Eels, are known to
be able to subsist without food for months, without showing a visible
decrease of bulk; whilst the Trigloids, Sparoids, and other marine
fishes, survive abstinence from food for a few days only. In freshwater
fishes the temperature of the water is of great influence on their
vital functions generally, and consequently on their appetite,—many
cease to feed altogether in the course of the winter; a few, like the
Pike, are less inclined to feed during the heat of the summer than when
the temperature is lowered.</p>

<p>Captivity is easily borne by most fishes, and the appliances introduced
in our modern aquaria have rendered it possible to keep in confinement,
and even to induce to propagate, fishes which formerly were considered
to be intolerant of captivity.</p>

<p>Wounds affect fishes generally much less than higher Vertebrates. A
Greenland Shark continues to feed whilst his head is pierced by a
harpoon or by the knife, as long as the nervous centre is not touched;
a Sea-perch or a Pike (Fig. <a href="#fig97">97</a>) will survive the loss of a portion of
its tail; a Carp that of half of its snout. However, some fishes are
much more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span> sensitive, and perish even from the superficial abrasion
caused by the meshes of the net during capture (<i>Mullsn</i>.)</p>

<p>The power of <i>reproduction</i> of <i>lost parts</i> in Teleosteous
fishes is limited to the delicate terminations of their fin-rays
and the various tegumentary filaments with which some are provided.
These filaments are sometimes developed in an extraordinary degree,
mimicking the waving fronds of the seaweed in which the fish hides.
Both the ends of the fin-rays and the filaments are frequently lost,
not only by accident, but merely by wear and tear; and as these organs
are essential for the preservation of the fish, their reproduction is
necessary.</p>

  </div>

<p>In Dipnoi, <i>Ceratodus</i>, and <i>Protopterus</i>, the terminal
portion of the tail has been found to have been reproduced, but without
the notochord.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>Hybernation</i> has been observed in many Cyprinoids and Murænoids
of the temperate zones. They do not fall into a condition of complete
torpidity, as Reptiles and Mammals, but their vital functions are
simply lowered, and they hide in sheltered holes, and cease to go
abroad in search of their food. Between the tropics a great number
of fishes (especially Siluroids, Labyrinthici, Ophiocephaloids, the
Dipnoi), are known to survive long-continued droughts by passing the
dry season in a perfectly torpid state, imbedded in the hardened mud.
Protopterus, and probably many of the other fishes mentioned, prepare
for themselves a cavity large enough to hold them, and coated on the
inside with a layer of hardened mucus, which preserves them from
complete desiccation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span> It has been stated that in India fishes may
survive in this condition for more than one season, and that ponds
known to have been dry for several years, and to the depth of many
feet, have swarmed with fishes as soon as the accumulation of water
released them from their hardened bed.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The principal <i>use</i> derived by man from the class of Fishes
consists in the abundance of wholesome and nourishing food which they
yield. In the Polar regions especially, whole tribes are entirely
dependent on this class for subsistence; and in almost all nations
fishes form a more or less essential part of food, many being, in a
preserved condition, most important articles of trade. The use derived
by man from them in other respects is of but secondary importance.
Cod-liver oil is prepared from the liver of some of the Gadoids of the
Northern Hemisphere, and of Sharks; isinglass from the swim-bladder of
Sturgeons, Sciænoids, and Polynemoids; shagreen from the skin of Sharks
and Rays.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The flesh of some fishes is at times, or constantly, <i>poisonous</i>.
When eaten, it causes symptoms of more or less intense irritation of
the stomach and intestines, inflammation of the mucous membranes,
and not rarely death. The fishes, the flesh of which appears always
to have poisonous properties, are <i>Clupea thrissa</i>, <i>Clupea
venenosa</i>, and some species of <i>Scarus</i>, <i>Tetrodon</i>,
and <i>Diodon</i>. There are many others which have occasionally or
frequently caused symptoms of poisoning. Poey enumerates not less
than seventy-two different kinds from Cuba; and various species of
<i>Sphyræna</i>, <i>Balistes</i>, <i>Ostracion</i>, <i>Caranx</i>,
<i>Lachnolæmus</i>, <i>Tetragonurus</i>, <i>Thynnus</i>, have been
found to be poisonous in all seas between the tropics. All or nearly
all these fishes acquire their poisonous properties from their food
which consists of poisonous Medusæ, Corals, or decomposing substances.
Frequently the fishes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span> are found to be eatable if the head and
intestines be removed immediately after capture. In the West Indies it
has been ascertained that all the fishes living and feeding on certain
coral banks are poisonous. In other fishes the poisonous properties are
developed at certain seasons of the year only, especially the season of
propagation: as the Barbel, Pike, and Burbot, whose roe causes violent
diarrhœas when eaten during the season of spawning.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>Poison-organs</i> are more common in the class of Fishes than was
formerly believed, but they seem to have exclusively the function
of defence, and are not auxiliary in procuring food, as in venomous
Snakes. Such organs are found in the Sting-rays, the tail of which is
armed with one or more powerful barbed spines. Although they lack a
special organ secreting poison, or a canal in or on the spine by which
the venomous fluid is conducted, the symptoms caused by a wound from
the spine of a Sting-ray are such as cannot be accounted for merely by
the mechanical laceration, the pain being intense, and the subsequent
inflammation and swelling of the wounded part terminating not rarely
in gangrene. The mucus secreted from the surface of the fish and
inoculated by the jagged spine evidently possesses venomous properties.
This is also the case in many Scorpænoids, and in the Weaver
(<i>Trachinis</i>), in which the dorsal and opercular spines have the
same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span> function as the caudal spines of the Sting-rays; however, in the
Weavers the spines are deeply grooved, the groove being charged with a
fluid mucus. In <i>Synanceia</i> the poison-organ (Fig. <a href="#fig99">99</a>,) is still
more developed: each dorsal spine is in its terminal half provided
with a deep groove on each side, at the lower end of which lies a
pear-shaped bag containing the milky poison; it is prolonged into a
membranous duct, lying in the groove of the spine, and open at its
point. The native fishermen, well acquainted with the dangerous nature
of these fishes, carefully avoid handling them; but it often happens
that persons wading with naked feet in the sea, step upon the fish,
which generally lies hidden in the sand. One or more of the erected
spines penetrate the skin, and the poison is injected into the wound by
the pressure of the foot on the poison-bags. Death has not rarely been
the result.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span></p>

<p>The most perfect poison-organs hitherto discovered in fishes are
those of <i>Thalassophryne</i>, a Batrachoid genus of fishes from the
coasts of Central America. In these fishes the operculum again and the
two dorsal spines are the weapons. The former (Fig. <a href="#fig100">100</a>, <sup>2</sup>) is very
narrow, vertically styliform and very mobile; it is armed behind with a
spine, eight lines long, and of the same form as the hollow venom-fang
of a snake, being perforated at its base and at its extremity. A sac
covering the base of the spine discharges its contents through the
apertures and the canal in the interior of the spine. The structure of
the dorsal spines is similar. There are no secretory glands imbedded
in the membranes of the sacs; and the fluid must be secreted by their
mucous membrane. The sacs are without an external muscular layer, and
situated immediately below the thick loose skin which envelops the
spines to their extremity; the ejection of the poison into a living
animal, therefore, can only be effected, as in <i>Synanceia</i>, by
the pressure to which the sac is subjected the moment the spine enters
another body.</p>

<p>Finally, a singular apparatus found in many Siluroids may be mentioned
in connection with the poison-organs, although its function is still
problematical. Some of these fishes are armed with powerful pectoral
spines and justly feared on account of the dangerous wounds they
inflict; not a few of them possess, in addition to the pectoral spines,
a sac with a more or less wide opening in the axil of the pectoral fin;
and it does not seem improbable that it contains a fluid which may be
introduced into a wound by means of the pectoral spine, which would
be covered with it, like the barbed arrow-head of an Indian. However,
whether this secretion is equally poisonous in all the species provided
with that axillary sac, or whether it has poisonous qualities at all,
is a question which can be decided by experiments only made with the
living fishes.</p>

<h2 class="smaller">CHAPTER XV.<br>
<span class="subhed">DISTRIBUTION OF FISHES IN TIME.</span></h2></div>

<p>Of what kind the fishes were which were the first to make their
appearance on the globe; whether or not they were identical with,
or similar to, any of the principal types existing at present; are
questions which probably will for ever remain hidden in mystery and
uncertainty. The supposition that the Leptocardii and Cyclostomes,
the lowest of the vertebrate series, must have preceded the other
sub-classes, is an idea which has been held by many Zoologists: and
as the horny teeth of the Cyclostomes are the only parts of their
body which under favourable circumstances might have been preserved,
Palæontologists have ever been searching for this evidence.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="fig101" style="max-width: 150px">

     <p class="p0 smaller">Fig. 101. Right dental plate of Myxine affinis.</p>
  </div>

<p>Indeed, in deposits belonging to the Lower Silurian and Devonian, in
Russia, England, and North America, minute, slender, pointed horny
bodies, bent like a hook, with sharp opposite margins, have been found
and described under the name of <i>Conodonts</i>. More frequently they
possess an elongated basal portion, in which there is generally a
larger tooth with rows of similar but smaller denticles on one or both
sides of the larger tooth, according as this is central or at one end
of the base. In other examples there is no prominent central tooth,
but a series of more or less similar teeth is implanted on a straight
or curved base. Modifications of these arrangements are very numerous,
and many Palæontologists entertain still doubts whether the origin
of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span> remains is not rather from Annelids and Mollusks than from
Fishes.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[See G. J. Hinde, in “Quarterly Journal of the Geological
Society,” 1879.]</p>
</div>

<p>The first undeniable evidence of a fish, or, indeed, of a vertebrate
animal, occurs in the <i>Upper Silurian</i> Rocks, in a bone-bed
of the Downton sandstone, near Ludlow. It consists of compressed,
slightly curved, ribbed spines, of less than two inches in length
(<i>Onchus</i>); of small shagreen-scales (<i>Thelodus</i>); the
fragment of a jaw-like bar with pluricuspid teeth (<i>Plectrodus</i>);
the cephalic bucklers of what seems to be a species of
<i>Pteraspis</i>; and, finally, the coprolitic bodies of phosphate and
carbonate of lime, including recognisable remains of the Mollusks and
Crinoids inhabiting the same waters. But no vertebra or other part
of the skeleton has been found. The spines and scales seem to have
belonged to the same kind of fish, which probably was a Plagiostome.
It is quite uncertain whether or not the jaw (if it be the jaw of
a fish<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>) belonged to the buckler-bearing <i>Pteraspis</i>, the
position of which among Ganoids, with which it is generally associated,
is open to doubt.</p>

<p>No detached undoubted tooth of a Plagiostome or Ganoid scale has been
discovered in the Ludlow deposits: but so much is certain that those
earliest remains in Palæozoic rocks belonged to fishes closely allied
to forms occurring in greater abundance in the succeeding formation,
the Devonian, where they are associated with undoubted Palæichthyes,
Plagiostomes as well as Ganoids.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>These fish-remains of the <i>Devonian</i> or <i>Old Red Sandstone</i>,
can be determined with greater certainty. They consist of spines
or the so-called <i>Ichthyodorulites</i>, which show sufficiently
distinctive characters to be referred to several genera, one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span> them,
<i>Onchus</i>, still surviving from the Silurian epoch. All these
spines are believed to be those of Chondropterygians, to which order
some pluricuspid teeth (<i>Cladodus</i>) from the Old Red Sandstone in
the vicinity of St. Petersburg have been referred likewise.</p>

<p>The remains of the Ganoid fishes are in a much more perfect state of
preservation, so that it is even possible to obtain a tolerably certain
idea of the general appearance and habits of some of them, especially
of such as were provided with hard carapaces, solid scales, and
ordinary or bony fin-rays. A certain proportion of them, as might have
been expected, remind us, with regard to external form, of Teleosteous
fishes rather than of any of the few still existing Ganoid types; but
it is contrary to all analogy and to all palæontological evidence
to suppose that those fishes were, with regard to their internal
structure, more nearly allied to Teleosteans than to Ganoids. If they
were not true Ganoids, they may be justly supposed to have had the
essential characters of Palæichthyes. Other forms exhibit even at that
remote geological epoch so unmistakably the characteristics of existing
Ganoids, that no one can entertain any doubt with regard to their place
in the system. In none of these fishes is there any trace of vertebral
segmentation.</p>

<p>The Palæichthyes of the Old Red Sandstone, the systematic position of
which is still obscure, are the <i>Cephalaspidæ</i> from the Lower Old
Red Sandstone of Great Britain and Eastern Canada; <i>Pterichthys</i>,
<i>Coccosteus</i>, and <i>Dinichthys</i>: genera which have been
combined in one group—<i>Placodermi</i>; and <i>Acanthodes</i>
and allied genera, which combined numerous branchiostegals with
chondropterygian spines and a shagreen-like dermal covering.</p>

<p>Among the other Devonian fishes (and they formed the majority) two
types may be recognised, both of which are unmistakably Ganoids. The
first approaches the still living<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span> <i>Polypterus</i>, with which
some of the genera like <i>Diplopterus</i> singularly agree in the
form and armature of the head, the lepidosis of the body, the lobate
pectoral fins, and the termination of the vertebral column. Other
genera, as <i>Holoptychius</i>, have cycloid scales; many have two
dorsal fins (<i>Holoptychius</i>), and, instead of branchiostegals,
jugular scutes; others one long dorsal confluent with the caudal
(<i>Phaneropleuron</i>).</p>

<p>In the second type the principal characters of the <i>Dipnoi</i>
are manifest, and some of them, for example <i>Dipterus</i>,
<i>Palædaphus</i>, <i>Holodus</i>, approach so closely the Dipnoi which
still survive, that the differences existing between them warrant a
separation into families only.</p>

<p>Devonian fishes are frequently found under peculiar circumstances,
enclosed in the so-called <i>nodules</i>. These bodies are elliptical
flattened pebbles, which have resisted the action of water in
consequence of their greater hardness, whilst the surrounding rock has
been reduced to detritus by that agency. Their greater density is due
to the dispersion in their substance of the fat of the animal which
decomposed in them. Frequently, on cleaving one of these nodules with
the stroke of the hammer, a fish is found embedded in the centre. At
certain localities of the Devonian, fossil fishes are so abundant
that the whole of the stratum is affected by the decomposing remains
emitting a peculiar smell when newly opened, and acquiring a density
and durability not possessed by strata without fishes. The flagstones
of Caithness are a remarkable instance of this.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The fish-remains of the <i>Carboniferous</i> formation show a great
similarity to those of the preceding. They occur throughout the series,
but are very irregularly distributed, being extremely scarce in some
countries, whilst in others entire beds (the so-called bone-beds) are
composed of ichthyolites.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span> In the ironstones they frequently form the
nuclei of nodules, as in the Devonian.</p>

<p>Of Chondropterygians the spines of <i>Onchus</i> and others still
occur, with the addition of teeth indicative of the existence of fishes
allied to the Cestracion-type (<i>Cochliodus</i>, <i>Psammodus</i>): a
type which henceforth plays an important part in the composition of the
extinct marine fish faunæ. Another extinct Selachian family, that of
Hybodontes, makes its appearance, but is known from the teeth only.</p>

<p>Of the Ganoid fishes, the family <i>Palæoniscidæ</i> (Traquair) is
numerously represented; others are Cœlacanths (<i>Cœlocanthus</i>,
<i>Rhizodus</i>), and <i>Saurodipteridæ</i> (<i>Megalichthys</i>).
None of these fishes have an ossified vertebral column, but in some
(<i>Megalichthys</i>) the outer surface of the vertebræ is ossified
into a ring; the termination of their tail is heterocercal. The
carboniferous <i>Uronemus</i> and the Devonian <i>Phaneropleuron</i>
are probably generically the same; and the Devonian <i>Dipnoi</i> are
continued as, and well represented by, <i>Ctenodus</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The fishes of the <i>Permian</i> group are very similar to those of
the Carboniferous. A type which in the latter was but very scantily
represented, namely the <i>Platysomidæ</i>, is much developed. They
were deep-bodied fish, covered with hard rhomboid scales possessing
a strong anterior rib, and provided with a heterocercal caudal, long
dorsal and anal, short non-lobate paired fins (when present), and
branchiostegals. The <i>Palæoniscidæ</i> are represented by many
species of <i>Palæoniscus</i>, <i>Pygopterus</i> and <i>Acrolepis</i>,
and Cestracionts by <i>Janassa</i> and <i>Strophodus</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The passage from the Palæozoic into the <i>Mesozoic</i> era is not
indicated by any marked change as far as fishes are concerned. The
more remarkable forms of the Trias are Shark-like fishes represented
by ichthyodorulithes like <i>Nemacanthus</i>, <i>Liacanthus</i>,
and <i>Hybodus</i>; and Cestracionts represented by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span> species
of <i>Acrodus</i> and <i>Strophodus</i>. Of the Ganoid genera
<i>Cœlacanthus</i>, <i>Amblypterus</i> (<i>Palæoniscidæ</i>),
<i>Saurichthys</i> persist from the Carboniferous epoch.
<i>Ceratodus</i> appears for the first time (Muschel-Kalk of Germany).</p>

<p>Thanks to the researches of Agassiz, and especially Sir P. Egerton,
the ichthyological fauna of the Lias is, perhaps, the best known
of the Mesozoic era, 152 species having been described. Of the
various localities, Lyme Regis has yielded more than any other,
nearly all the Liassic genera being represented there by not less
than seventy-nine species. The Hybodonts and Cestracionts continue
in their fullest development. Holocephales (<i>Ischyodus</i>),
true Sharks (<i>Palæoscyllium</i>), Rays (<i>Squaloraja</i>,
<i>Arthropterus</i>), and Sturgeons (<i>Chondrosteus</i>) make
their first appearance; but they are sufficiently distinct from
living types to be classed in separate genera, or even families. The
Ganoids, especially Lepidosteoids, predominate over all the other
fishes: <i>Lepidotus</i>, <i>Semionotus</i>, <i>Pholidophorus</i>,
<i>Pachycormus</i>, <i>Eugnathus</i>, <i>Tetragonolepis</i>, are
represented by numerous species; other remarkable genera are
<i>Aspidorhynchus</i>, <i>Belonostomus</i>, <i>Saurostomus</i>,
<i>Sauropsis</i>, <i>Thrissonotus</i>, <i>Conodus</i>,
<i>Ptycholepis</i>, <i>Endactis</i>, <i>Centrolepis</i>,
<i>Legnonotus</i>, <i>Oxygnathus</i>, <i>Heterolepidotus</i>,
<i>Isocolum</i>, <i>Osteorhachis</i>, <i>Mesodon</i>. These genera
offer evidence of a great change since the preceding period, the
majority not being represented in older strata, whilst, on the other
hand, many are continued into the succeeding oolithic formations. The
homocercal termination of the vertebral column commences to supersede
the heterocercal, and many of the genera have well ossified and
distinctly segmented spinal columns. Also the cycloid form of scales
becomes more common: one genus (<i>Leptolepis</i>) being, with regard
to the preserved hard portions of its organisation, so similar to the
Teleosteous type that some Palæontologists refer it (with much reason)
to that sub-class.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span></p>

<p>As already mentioned, the <i>Oolithic</i> formations show a great
similarity of their fish-fauna to that of the Lias; but still more
apparent is its approach to the existing fauna. Teeth have been found
which cannot even generically be distinguished from <i>Notidanus</i>.
The Rays are represented by genera like <i>Spathobatis</i>,
<i>Belemnobatis</i>, <i>Thaumas</i>; the <i>Holocephali</i> are
more numerous than in the Lias (<i>Ischyodus</i>, <i>Ganodus</i>).
The most common Ganoid genera are <i>Caturus</i>, <i>Pycnodus</i>,
<i>Pholidophorus</i>, <i>Lepidotus</i>, <i>Leptolepis</i>, all of
which had been more or less fully represented in the Lias. Also
<i>Ceratodus</i> is continued into it.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The <i>Cretaceous</i> group offers clear evidence of the further
advance towards the existing fauna. Teeth of Sharks of existing genera
<i>Carcharias</i> (<i>Corax</i>), <i>Scyllium</i>, <i>Notidanus</i>,
and <i>Galeocerdo</i>, are common in some of the marine strata, whilst
Hybodonts and Cestracionts are represented by a small number of
species only; of the latter one new genus, <i>Ptychodus</i>, appears
and disappears. A very characteristic Ganoid genus, <i>Macropoma</i>,
comprises homocercal fishes with rounded ganoid scales sculptured
externally and pierced by prominent mucous tubes. <i>Caturus</i>
becomes extinct. Teeth and scales of <i>Lepidotus</i> (with
<i>Sphærodus</i> as subgenus), clearly a freshwater fish, are widely
distributed in the Wealden, and finally disappear in the chalk; its
body was covered with large rhomboidal ganoid scales. <i>Gyrodus</i>
and <i>Aspidorhynchus</i> occur in the beds of Voirons, <i>Coelodus</i>
and <i>Amiopsis</i> (allied to Amra), in those of Comen, in Istria. But
the Palæichthyes are now in the minority; undoubted Teleosteans have
appeared, for the first time, on the stage of life in numerous genera,
many of which are identical with still existing fishes. The majority
are Acanthopterygians, but Physostomes and Plectognaths are likewise
well represented, most of them being marine. Of Acanthopterygian
families the first to appear are the <i>Berycidæ</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span> represented
by several very distinct genera: <i>Beryx</i>; <i>Pseudoberyx</i>
with abdominal ventral fins; <i>Berycopsis</i> with cycloid scales;
<i>Homonotus</i>, <i>Stenostoma</i>, <i>Sphenocephalus</i>,
<i>Acanus</i>, <i>Hoplopteryx</i>, <i>Platycornus</i> with
granular scales; <i>Podocys</i> with a dorsal extending to the
neck; <i>Acrogaster</i>, <i>Macrolepis</i>, <i>Rhacolepis</i>
from the chalk of Brazil. The position of <i>Pycnosterynx</i> is
uncertain, it approaches certain Pharyngognaths. True <i>Percidæ</i>
are absent, whilst the <i>Carangidæ</i>, <i>Sphyrænidæ</i>,
<i>Cataphracti</i>, <i>Gobiidæ</i>, <i>Cottidæ</i>, and <i>Sparidæ</i>
are represented by one or more genera. Somewhat less diversified are
the Physostomes, which belong principally to the <i>Clupeidæ</i>
and <i>Dercetidæ</i>, most of the genera being extinct; Clupea is
abundant in some localities. <i>Scopelidæ</i> (<i>Hemisaurida</i>
and <i>Saurocephalus</i>) occur in the chalk of Comen in Istria, and
of Mæstricht. Of all cretaceous deposits none surpass those of the
Lebanon with regard to the number of genera, species, and individuals;
the forms are exclusively marine, and the remains in the most perfect
condition.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In the <i>Tertiary</i> epoch the Teleosteans have almost entirely
replaced the Ganoids; a few species only of the latter make their
appearance, and they belong to existing genera, or, at least, very
closely allied forms (<i>Lepidosteus</i>, <i>Amia</i>, <i>Hypamia</i>,
<i>Acipenser</i>). The Chondropterygians merge more and more into
recent forms; Holocephali continue, and still are better represented
than in the present fauna. The Teleosteans show even in the Eocene a
large proportion of existing genera, and the fauna of some localities
of the Miocene (Oeningen) is almost wholly composed of them. On the
whole, hitherto more than one-half have been found to belong to
existing genera, and there is no doubt that the number of seemingly
distinct extinct genera will be lessened as the fossils will be
examined with a better knowledge of the living forms. The distribution
of the fishes differed widely from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span> that of our period, many of our
tropical genera occurring in localities which are now included within
our temperate zone, and being mixed with others, which nowadays are
restricted to a colder climate: a mixture which continues throughout
the Pliocene.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A few families of fishes, like the freshwater Salmonidæ, seem to have
put in their appearance in <i>Post-pliocene</i> times; however, not
much attention has been paid to fish-remains of these deposits; and
such as have been incidentally examined offer evidence of the fact that
the distribution of fishes has not undergone any further essential
change down to the present period.</p>

<span class="subhed">THE DISTRIBUTION OF EXISTING FISHES OVER THE EARTH’S SURFACE—GENERAL
REMARKS.</span></h2></div>

<p>In an account of the geographical distribution of fishes the
<i>Freshwater</i> forms are to be kept separate from the <i>Marine</i>.
However, when we attempt to draw a line between these two kinds of
fishes, we meet with a great number of species and of facts which would
seem to render that distinction very vague. There are not only species
which can gradually accommodate themselves to a sojourn in either salt
or fresh water, but there are also such as seem to be quite indifferent
to a rapid change from one into the other: so that individuals of
one and the same species (Gastrosteus, Gobius, Blennius, Osmerus,
Retropinna, Clupea, Syngnathus, etc.), may be found at some distance
out at sea, whilst others live in rivers far beyond the influence of
the tide, or even in inland fresh waters without outlet to the sea.
The majority of these fishes belong to forms of the fauna of the
<i>brackish</i> water, and as they are not an insignificant portion of
the fauna of almost every coast, we shall have to treat of them in a
separate chapter.</p>

<p>Almost every large river offers instances of truly marine fishes
(such as <i>Serranus</i>, <i>Sciænidæ</i>, <i>Pleuronectes</i>,
<i>Clupeidæ</i>, <i>Tetrodon</i>, <i>Carcharias</i>, <i>Trygonidæ</i>),
ascending for hundreds of miles of their course; and not periodically,
or from any apparent physiological necessity, but sporadically
throughout the year, just like the various kinds of marine
Porpoises which are found all along the lower course of the Ganges,
Yang-tseKiang,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span> the Amazons, the Congo, etc. This is evidently the
commencement of a change in a fish’s habits, and, indeed, not a few
of such fishes have actually taken up their permanent residence in
fresh waters (as species of Ambassis, Apogon Dules, Therapon, Sciæna,
Blennius, Gobius, Atherina, Mugil, Myxus, Hemirhamphus, Clupea,
Anguilla, Tetrodon, Trygon): all forms <i>originally marine</i>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we find fishes belonging to freshwater genera
descending rivers and sojourning in the sea for a more or less limited
period; but these instances are much less in number than those in
which the reverse obtains. We may mention species of <i>Salmo</i> (the
Common Trout, the Northern Charr), and Siluroids (as <i>Arius</i>,
<i>Plotosus</i>). <i>Coregonus</i>, a genus so characteristic of the
inland lakes of Europe, Northern Asia, and North America, nevertheless
offers some instances of species wandering by the effluents into
the sea, and taking up their residence in salt water, apparently
by preference, as <i>Coregonus oxyrhynchus</i>. But of all the
Freshwater families none exhibit so great a capability of surviving
the change from fresh into salt water, as the <i>Gastrosteidæ</i>
(Sticklebacks), of the northern Hemisphere, and the equally diminutive
<i>Cyprinodontidæ</i> of the tropics; not only do they enter into,
and live freely in, the sea, but many species of the latter family
inhabit inland waters, which, not having an outlet, have become briny,
or impregnated with a larger proportion of salts than pure sea water.
During the voyage of the “Challenger” a species of <i>Fundulus</i>,
<i>F. nigrofasciatus</i>, which inhabits the fresh and brackish waters
of the Atlantic States of North America, was obtained, with Scopelids
and other pelagic forms, in the tow-net, midway between St. Thomas and
Teneriffe.</p>

<p>Some fishes annually or periodically ascend rivers for the purpose of
spawning, passing the rest of the year in the sea, as Sturgeons, many
Salmonoids, some Clupeoids, Lampreys,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span> etc. The two former evidently
belonged originally to the freshwater series, and it was only in the
course of their existence that they acquired the habit of descending
to the sea, perhaps because their freshwater home did not offer a
sufficient supply of food. These migrations of freshwater fishes have
been compared with the migrations of birds; but they are much more
limited in extent, and do not impart an additional element to the fauna
of the place to which they migrate, as is the case with the distant
countries to which birds migrate.</p>

<p>The distinction between freshwater and marine fishes is further
obscured by geological changes, in consequence of which the salt water
is gradually being changed into fresh, or <i>vice versa</i>. These
changes are so gradual and spread over so long a time, that many of
the fishes inhabiting such localities accommodate themselves to the
new conditions. One of the most remarkable and best studied instances
of such an alteration is the Baltic, which, during the second half of
the Glacial period, was in open and wide communication with the Arctic
Ocean, and evidently had the same marine fauna as the White Sea. Since
then, by the rising of the land of Northern Scandinavia and Finland,
this great gulf of the Arctic Ocean has become an inland sea, with
a narrow outlet into the North Sea, and its water, in consequence
of the excess of the fresh water pouring into it over the loss by
evaporation, has been so much diluted as to be nearly fresh at its
northern extremities: and yet nine species, the origin of which from
the Arctic Ocean can be proved, have survived the changes, propagating
their species, agreeing with their brethren in the Arctic Ocean in
every point, but remaining comparatively smaller. On the other hand,
fishes which we must regard as true freshwater fishes, like the Rudd,
Roach, Pike, Perch, enter freely the brackish water of the Baltic.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
Instances of marine fishes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span> being permanently retained in fresh water
in consequence of geological changes are well known: thus <i>Cottus
quadricornis</i> in the large lakes of Scandinavia; species of
<i>Gobius</i>, <i>Blennius</i>, and <i>Atherina</i> in the lakes of
Northern Italy; <i>Comephorus</i>, of the depths of the Lake of Baikal,
which seems to be a dwarfed Gadoid. <i>Carcharias gangeticus</i> in
inland lakes of the Fiji Islands, is another instance of a marine fish
which has permanently established itself in fresh water.</p>

<p>In the miocene formation of Licata in Sicily, in which fish remains
abound, numerous Cyprinoids are mixed with littoral and pelagic
forms. Sauvage found in 450 specimens from that locality, not less
than 266, which were Leucisci, Alburni, or Rhodei. Now, although it
is quite possible that in consequence of a sudden catastrophe the
bodies of those Cyprinoids were carried by a freshwater current into,
and deposited on the bottom of, the sea, the surmise that they lived
together with the littoral fishes in the brackish water of a large
estuary, which was not rarely entered by pelagic forms, is equally
admissible. And, if confirmed by other similar observations, this
instance of a mixture of forms which are now strictly freshwater or
marine, may have an important bearing on the question to what extent
fishes have in time changed their original habitat.</p>

<p>Thus there is a constant exchange of species in progress between the
freshwater and marine faunæ, and in not a few cases it would seem
almost arbitrary to refer a genus or even larger group of fishes
to one or the other; yet there are certain groups of fishes which
entirely, or with but few exceptions are, and, apparently, during
the whole period of their existence have been, inhabitants either of
the sea or of fresh water; and as the agencies operating upon the
distribution of marine fishes differ greatly from those influencing
the dispersal of freshwater fishes, the two series must be treated
separately. The most obvious fact that dry land, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span> intervenes
between river systems, offers to the rapid spreading of a freshwater
fish an obstacle which can be surmounted only exceptionally or by a
most circuitous route, whilst marine fishes may readily and voluntarily
extend their original limits, could be illustrated by a great number
of instances. Without entering into details, it may suffice to state
as the general result, that no species or genus of freshwater fishes
has anything like the immense range of the corresponding categories
of marine fishes; and that, with the exception of the Siluroids,
no other freshwater family is so widely spread as the families of
marine fishes. Surface temperature or climate which is, if not the
most, one of the most important physical factors in the limitation
of freshwater fishes, similarly affects the distribution of marine
fishes, but in a less degree, and only those which live near to the
shore or the surface of the ocean; whilst it ceases to exercise its
influence in proportion to the depth, the true deep-sea forms being
entirely exempt from its operation. Light, which is pretty equally
distributed over the localities inhabited by freshwater fishes, cannot
be considered as an important factor in their distribution, but it
contributes towards constituting the impassable barrier between the
surface and abyssal forms of marine fishes. Altitude has stamped the
fishes of the various Alpine provinces of the globe with a certain
character, and limited their distribution; but the number of these
Alpine forms is comparatively small, ichthyic life being extinguished
at great elevations even before the mean temperature equals that of the
high latitudes of the Arctic region, in which some freshwater fishes
flourish. On the other hand, the depths of the ocean, far exceeding the
altitude of the highest mountains, still swarm with forms specially
adapted for abyssal life. That other physical conditions of minor and
local importance, under which fresh water fishes live, and by which
their dispersal is regulated, are more complicated than similar ones
of the ocean, is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span> probable, though perhaps less so than is generally
supposed: for the fact is that the former are more accessible to
observation than the latter, and are, therefore, more generally and
more readily comprehended and acknowledged. Thus, not only because many
of the most characteristic forms of the marine and freshwater series
are found, on taking a broader view of the subject, to be sufficiently
distinct, but also because their distribution depends on causes
different in their nature as well as the degree of their action, it
will be necessary to treat of the two series separately. Whether the
oceanic areas correspond in any way to the terrestrial will be seen in
the sequel.</p>

<p>Having shown above that numerous marine fishes enter fresh waters, and
that some of them have permanently established themselves therein,
we have to eliminate from the category of freshwater fishes all such
adventitious elements. They are derived from forms, the distribution
of which is regulated by other agencies, and which, therefore, would
obscure the relations of the faunæ of terrestrial regions if they were
included in them. They will be mentioned with greater propriety along
with the fishes constituting the fauna of the brackish water.</p>

<p>As in every other class of animals, these freshwater genera and
families vary greatly with regard to the extent of their geographical
range; some extend over the greater half of the continental areas,
whilst others are limited to one continent only, or even to a very
small portion of it. As a general rule, a genus or family of freshwater
fishes is regularly dispersed and most developed within a certain
district, the species and individuals becoming scarcer towards the
periphery as the type recedes more from its central home, some outposts
being frequently pushed far beyond the outskirts of the area occupied
by it. But there are not wanting those remarkable instances of closely
allied forms occurring, almost isolated, at most distant points,
without being connected by allied species in the intervening space;
or of members of the same family, genus, or species inhabiting the
opposite shores of an ocean, and separated by many degrees of abyssal
depths. We mention of a multitude of such instances the following
only:—</p>


<p class="p1"><i>A</i>. Species identical in distant continents—</p>

<p>1. A number of species inhabiting Europe and the temperate parts of
eastern North America, as <i>Perca fluviatilis</i>, <i>Gastrosteus
pungitius</i>, <i>Lota vulgaris</i>, <i>Salmo solar</i>, <i>Esox
lucius</i>, <i>Acipenser sturio</i>, <i>Acipenser maculosus</i>, and
several Petromyzonts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span></p>

<p>2. <i>Lates calcarifer</i> is common in India as well as in Queensland.</p>

<p>3. <i>Galaxias attenuatus</i> inhabits Tasmania, New Zealand, the
Falkland Islands, and the southernmost part of the South American
continent.</p>

<p>4. Several Petromyzonts enter the fresh waters of Tasmania, South
Australia, New Zealand, and Chili.</p>


<p class="p1"><i>B.</i> Genera identical in distant continents—</p>

<p>1. The genus <i>Umbra</i>, so peculiar a form as to be the type of a
distinct family consisting of two most closely allied species only, one
of which is found in the Atlantic States of North America, the other in
the system of the Danube.</p>

<p>2. A very distinct genus of Sturgeons, <i>Scaphirhynchus</i>,
consisting of two species only, one inhabiting fresh waters of Central
Asia, the other the system of the Mississippi.</p>

<p>3. A second most peculiar genus of Sturgeons, <i>Polyodon</i>, consists
likewise of two species only, one inhabiting the Mississippi, the other
the Yang-tse-kiang.</p>

<p>4. <i>Amiurus</i>, a Siluroid, and <i>Catostomus</i>, a Cyprinoid
genus, both well represented in North America, occur in a single
species in temperate China.</p>

<p>5. <i>Lepidosiren</i> is represented by one species in tropical
America, and by the second in tropical Africa (<i>Protopterus</i>).</p>

<p>6. <i>Notopterus</i> consists of three Indian and two West African
species.</p>

<p>7. <i>Mastacembelus</i> and <i>Ophiocephalus</i>, genera characteristic
of the Indian region, emerge severally by a single species in West and
Central Africa.</p>

<p>8. <i>Symbranchus</i> has two Indian and one South American species.</p>

<p>9. <i>Prototroctes</i>, the singular antarctic analogue of
<i>Coregonus</i>, consists of two species, one in the south of
Australia the other in New Zealand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span></p>

<p>10. <i>Galaxias</i> is equally represented in Southern Australia, New
Zealand, and the southern parts of South America.</p>


<p class="p1"><i>C.</i> Families identical in distant continents—</p>

<p>1. The <i>Labyrinthici</i>, represented in Africa by 5, and in India by
25 species.</p>

<p>2. The <i>Chromides</i>, represented in Africa by 25, and in South
America by 80 species.</p>

<p>3. The <i>Characinidæ</i>, represented in Africa by 35, and in South
America by 226 species.</p>

<p>4. The <i>Haplochitonidæ</i>, represented in Southern Australia by one,
in New Zealand by one, and in Patagonia by a third species.</p>

<p>This list could be much increased from the families of <i>Siluridæ</i>
and <i>Cyprinidæ</i>, but as these have a greater range than the other
Freshwater fishes, they do not illustrate with equal force the object
for which the list has been composed.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The ways in which the dispersal of Freshwater fishes has been effected
were various; they are probably all still in operation, but most work
so slowly and imperceptibly as to escape direct observation; perhaps,
they will be more conspicuous, after science and scientific inquiry
shall have reached to a somewhat greater age. From the great number
of freshwater forms which we see at this present day acclimatised in,
gradually acclimatising themselves in, or periodically or sporadically
migrating into, the sea, we must conclude that, under certain
circumstances, salt water may cease to be an impassable barrier at some
period of the existence of freshwater species, and that many of them
have passed from one river through salt water into another. Secondly,
the headwaters of some of the grandest rivers, the mouths of which are
at opposite ends of the continents which they drain, are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span> sometimes
distant from each other a few miles only; the intervening space may
have been easily bridged over for the passage of fishes by a slight
geological change affecting the level of the watershed, or even by
temporary floods; and a communication of this kind, if existing for a
limited period only, would afford the ready means of an exchange of
a number of species previously peculiar to one or the other of those
river or lake systems. Some fishes, provided with gill-openings so
narrow that the water moistening the gills cannot readily evaporate;
and endowed, besides, with an extraordinary degree of vitality, like
many Siluroids (<i>Clarias</i>, <i>Callichthys</i>), Eels, etc., are
enabled to wander for some distance over land, and may thus reach
a water-course leading them thousands of miles from their original
home. Finally, fishes or their ova may be accidentally carried by
waterspouts, by aquatic birds or insects, to considerable distances.</p>

<p>Freshwater fishes of the present fauna were already in existence when
the great changes of the distribution of land and water took place
in the tertiary epoch; and having stated that salt water is not an
absolute barrier to the spreading of Freshwater fishes, we can now
more easily account for those instances of singular disconnection of
certain families or genera. It is not necessary to assume that there
was a continuity of land stretching from the present coast of Africa
to South America, or from South America to New Zealand and Australia,
to explain the presence of identical forms at so distant localities;
it suffices to assume that the distances were lessened by intervening
archipelagoes, or that an oscillation has taken place in the level of
the land area.</p>

<p>Dispersal of a type over several distant continental areas may be
evidence of its great antiquity, but it does not prove that it is of
greater antiquity than another limited to one region only. Geological
evidence is the only proof of the antiquity of a type. Thus, although
the <i>Dipnoi</i> occur on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span> continents of Africa, South America,
and Australia, and their present distribution is evidently the
consequence of their wide range in palæozoic and secondary epochs; the
proof of their high antiquity can be found in their fossil remains
only. For, though the Siluroids have a still greater range, their wide
distribution is of comparatively recent date, as the few fossil remains
that have been found belong to the tertiary epoch. The rapidity of
dispersal of a type depends entirely on its facility to accommodate
itself to a variety of physical conditions, and on the degree of
vitality by which it is enabled to survive more or less sudden changes
under unfavourable conditions; proof of this is afforded by the family
of Siluroids, many of which can suspend for some time the energy of
their respiratory functions, and readily survive a change of water.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>To trace the geological sequence of the distribution of an ichthyic
type, and to recognise the various laws which have governed, and
are still governing its dispersal, is one of the ultimate tasks of
Ichthyology. But the endeavour to establish by means of our present
fragmentary geological knowledge the divisions of the fauna of the
globe, leads us into a maze of conflicting evidence; or, as Mr.
Wallace truly observes, “any attempt to exhibit the regions of former
geological ages in combination with those of our own period must lead
to confusion.” Nevertheless, as the different types of animals found
at the present day within a particular area have made their appearance
therein at distant periods, we should endeavour to decide as far as
we can, in an account of the several zoo-geographical divisions, the
following questions:—</p>

<p>1. Which of the fishes of an area should be considered to be the
remnants of <i>ancient</i> types, probably spread over much larger
areas in preceding epochs?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span></p>

<p>2. Which of them are to be considered to be <i>autochthont</i> species,
that is, forms which came in the tertiary epoch or later into existence
within the area to which they are still limited, or from which they
have since spread?</p>

<p>3. Which are the forms which must be considered to be <i>immigrants</i>
from some other region?</p>

<p>The mode of division of the earth’s surface into zoological regions
or areas now generally adopted, is that proposed by Mr. Sclater,
which recommends itself as most nearly agreeing with the geographical
divisions. These regions are as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="p-left">I. <span class="smcap">Palæogæa.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="hangingindent">1. The <i>Palæarctic</i> region; including Europe,
temperate Asia, and North Africa.</p>

<p class="hangingindent">2. The <i>Ethiopian</i> region; including Africa, south
of the Sahara, Madagascar, and the Mascarene Islands;
also Southern Arabia.</p>

<p class="hangingindent">3. The <i>Indian</i> region; including India south of the
Himalayas, to Southern China, Borneo, and Java.</p>

<p class="hangingindent">4. The <i>Australian</i> region; including Australia, the
Pacific Islands, Celebes, and Lombock.</p>
</div>

<p class="p-left">II. <span class="smcap">Neogæa.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="hangingindent">5. The <i>Nearctic</i> region; including North America to
Northern Mexico.</p>

<p class="hangingindent">6. The <i>Neotropical</i> region; including South
America, the West Indies, and Southern Mexico.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Comparatively few classes and orders of animals have been carefully
studied with regard to their geographical distribution, but the
majority of those which have been examined show that the difference
of latitude is accompanied by a greater dissimilarity of indigenous
species than that of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span> longitude, and that a main division into an old
world and new world fauna is untenable. More especially the Freshwater
fishes, with which we are here solely concerned, have been spread in
<i>circumpolar</i> zones, and in a but limited degree from north to
south. No family, much less a genus, ranges from the north to the
south, whilst a number of families and genera make the entire circuit,
and some species more than half of the circuit round the globe within
the zone to which they belong. Not even the Cyprinoids and Siluroids,
which are most characteristic of the freshwater fauna of our period,
are an exception to this. Temperature and climate, indeed, are the
principal factors by which the character of the freshwater fauna is
determined; they form the barriers which interfere with the unlimited
dispersal of an ichthyic type, much more than mountain ranges, deserts,
or oceans. Hence the tropical zone is an impassable barrier to the
northern Freshwater fish in its progress towards the south; where
a similarly temperate climate obtains in the southern hemisphere,
fish-forms appear <i>analogous</i> to those of the north, but
<i>genetically</i> and <i>structurally distinct</i>.</p>

<p>The similarity which obtains in fishes at somewhat distant points
of the same degree of longitude, rarely extends far, and is due to
the natural tendency of every animal to spread as far as physical
conditions will permit. Between two regions situated north and south
of each other there is always a debateable border ground, in parts of
which sometimes the fishes of the one, sometimes those of the other,
predominate, and which is, in fact, a <i>band</i> of demarcation.
Within this band the regions overlap each other; therefore, their
border <i>lines</i> are rarely identical, and should be determined by
the northern and southernmost extent of the most characteristic types
of each region. Thus, for instance, in China, a broad band intervenes
between temperate and tropical Asia, in which these two faunæ mix, and
the actual northern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span> border line of the tropical fauna is north of the
southern border line of temperate Asia.</p>

<p>It is the aim of every philosophical classification to indicate the
degree of affinity which obtains between the various divisions; but
the mode of division into six equivalent regions, as given above, does
not fulfil this aim with regard to Freshwater fishes, the distribution
of which allows of further generalisation and subdivision. The two
families, <i>Cyprinidæ</i> and <i>Siluridæ</i>, of which the former
yields a contingent of one-third, and the latter of one-fourth of
all the freshwater species known of our period, afford most valuable
guidance for the valuation of the degrees of affinity between the
various divisions. The Cyprinoids may be assumed to have taken their
origin in the Alpine region, dividing the temperate and tropical parts
of Asia; endowed with a greater capability of acclimatising themselves
in a temperate as well as tropical climate than any other family of
freshwater fishes, they spread north and south as well as east and
west; in the preglacial epoch they reached North America, but they have
not had time to penetrate into South America, Australia, or the islands
of the Pacific. The Siluroids, principally fishes of the sluggish
waters of the plains, and well adapted for surviving changes of the
water in which they live, for living in mud or sea-water, flourish
most in the tropical climate, in which this type evidently had its
origin. They came into existence after the Cyprinoids, fossil remains
being known only from tertiary deposits in India, none from Europe.
They rapidly spread over the areas of land within the tropical zone,
reaching northern Australia from India, and one species even immigrated
into the Sandwich Islands, probably from South America. The Coral
Islands of the Pacific still remain untenanted by them. Their progress
into temperate regions was evidently slow, only very few species
penetrating into the temperate parts of Asia and Europe; and the North
American species,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span> although more numerous, showing no great variety of
structure, all belonging to the same group (<i>Amiurina</i>). Towards
the south their progress was still slower, Tasmania, New Zealand, and
Patagonia being without representatives, whilst the streams of the
Andes of Chili are inhabited by a few dwarfed forms identical with such
as are characteristic of similar localities in the more northern and
warmer parts of the South American continent.</p>

<p>After these preliminary remarks we propose the following division of
the fauna of Freshwater fishes:—</p>

<p class="hangingindent">I. <span class="smcap">The Northern Zone</span>.—Characterised by Acipenseridæ. Few
Siluridæ. Numerous Cyprinidæ. Salmonidæ, Esocidæ.</p>

<p class="hangingindent1">1. <i>Europo-Asiatic or Palæarctic Region</i>.—Characterised by
absence of osseous Ganoidei; Cobitidæ and Barbus numerous.</p>

<p class="hangingindent1">2. <i>North American Region</i>.—Characterised by osseous Ganoidei,
Amiurina, and Catostomina; but no Cobitidæ or Barbus.</p>

<p class="hangingindent">II. <span class="smcap">The Equatorial Zone</span>.—Characterised by the development of
Siluridæ.</p>

<p class="hangingindent1">A. <i>Cyprinoid Division</i>.—Characterised by presence of Cyprinidæ
and Labyrinthici.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">1. <i>Indian Region</i>.—Characterised by [absence of Dipnoi<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>]
Ophiocephalidæ, Mastacembelidæ. Cobitidæ numerous.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">2. <i>African Region</i>.—Characterised by presence of Dipnoi and
Polypteridæ. Chromides and Characinidæ numerous. Mormyridæ. Cobitidæ
absent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span></p>

<p class="hangingindent1">B. <i>Acyprinoid Division</i>.—Characterised by absence of Cyprinidæ
and Labyrinthici.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">1. <i>Tropical American Region</i>.—Characterised by presence of
Dipnoi. Chromides and Characinidæ numerous. Gymnotidæ.</p>

<p class="hangingindent2">2. <i>Tropical Pacific Region</i>.—Characterised by presence of
Dipnoi. Chromides and Characinidæ absent.</p>

<p class="hangingindent">III. <span class="smcap">The Southern Zone</span>.—Characterised by absence of
Cyprinidæ, and scarcity of Siluridæ. Haplochitonidæ and Galaxiidæ
represent the Salmonoids and Esoces of the Northern zone. One region
only.</p>

<p class="hangingindent1">1. <i>Antarctic Region</i>.—Characterised by the small number of
species; the fishes of—</p>

<p class="hangingindent2"><i>a</i>. The Tasmanian sub-region; <i>b</i>. The New Zealand
sub-region; <i>c</i>. The Patagonian sub-region;</p>

<p class="p-left">being almost identical.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>In the following detailed account we begin with a description of the
equatorial zone, this being the one from which the two principal
families of freshwater fishes seem to have spread.</p>

<h3>I. <span class="smcap">Equatorial Zone</span>.</h3>

<p>Roughly speaking, the borders of this zoological zone coincide with
the geographical limits of the tropical zone, the tropics of the
Cancer and Capricorn; its characteristic forms, however, extend in
undulating lines several degrees north and southwards. Commencing from
the west coast of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span> Africa the desert of the Sahara forms a well-marked
boundary between the equatorial and northern zones; as the boundary
approaches the Nile it makes a sudden sweep towards the north as far as
Northern Syria (<i>Mastacembelus</i>, near Aleppo, and in the Tigris;
<i>Clarias</i> and <i>Chromides</i>, in the lake of Galilee); crosses
through Persia and Afghanistan (<i>Ophiocephalus</i>), to the southern
ranges of the Himalayas, and follows the course of the Yang-tse-Kiang,
which receives its contingent of equatorial fishes through its
southern tributaries. Its continuation through the North Pacific may
be considered to be indicated by the tropic which strikes the coast
of Mexico at the southern end of the Gulf of California. Equatorial
types of South America are known to extend so far northwards; and by
following the same line the West India Islands are naturally included
in this zone.</p>

<p>Towards the south the equatorial zone embraces the whole of Africa
and Madagascar, and seems to extend still farther south in Australia,
its boundary probably following the southern coast of that continent;
the detailed distribution of the freshwater fishes of South-Western
Australia has been but little studied, but the few facts which we
know show that the tropical fishes of Queensland follow the principal
water-course of that country, the Murray River, far towards the
south and probably to its mouth. The boundary-line then stretches
northwards of Tasmania and New Zealand, coinciding with the tropic
until it strikes the western slope of the Andes, on the South American
Continent, where it again bends southwards to embrace the system of the
Rio de la Plata.</p>

<p>The equatorial zone is divided into four regions:—</p>

<div class="parent">
<ul class="left" style="margin-top: 0em">
  <li>A. The Indian region.</li>
  <li>B. The African region.</li>
  <li>C. The Tropical American region.</li>
  <li>D. The Tropical Pacific region.</li>
</ul>
</div>  

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span></p>

<p>These four regions diverge into two well-marked divisions, one of
which is characterised by the presence of Cyprinoid fishes, combined
with the development of Labyrinthici; whilst in the other both these
types are absent. The boundary between the Cyprinoid and Acyprinoid
division seems to follow Wallace’s line, a line drawn from the south of
the Philippines between Borneo and Celebes, and farther south between
Bali and Lombock. Borneo abounds in Cyprinoids; from the Philippine
Islands a few only are known at present, and in Bali two species have
been found; but none are known from Celebes or Lombock, or from islands
situated farther east of them.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>Taking into consideration the manner in which Cyprinoids and Siluroids
have been dispersed, we are obliged to place the Indian region as
the first in the order of our treatment; and indeed the number of
its freshwater fishes, which appear to have spread from it into the
neighbouring regions, far exceeds that of the species which it has
received from them.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A. The <span class="smcap">Indian Region</span> comprises the whole continent of Asia
south of the Himalayas and the Yang-tse-kiang; it includes the islands
to the west of Wallace’s line. Towards the north-east the island of
Formosa, which also by other parts of its fauna leans more towards the
equatorial zone, has received some characteristic Japanese Freshwater
fishes, for instance, the singular Salmonoid <i>Plecoglossus</i>.
Within the geographical boundaries of China the Freshwater fishes of
the tropics pass gradually into those of the northern zone, both being
separated by a broad debateable ground. The affluents of the great
river traversing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span> this district are more numerous from the south than
from the north, and carry the southern fishes far into the temperate
zone. The boundary of this region towards the north-west is scarcely
better defined. Before Persia passed through the geological changes by
which its waters were converted into brine and finally dried up, it
seems to have been inhabited by many characteristic Indian forms, of
which a few still survive in the tract intervening between Afghanistan
and Syria; <i>Ophiocephalus</i> and <i>Discognathus</i> have each at
least one representative, <i>Macrones</i> has survived in the Tigris,
and Mastacembelus has penetrated as far as Aleppo. Thus, Freshwater
fishes belonging to India, Africa, and Europe, are intermingled in a
district which forms the connecting link between the three continents.
Of the freshwater fishes of Arabia we are perfectly ignorant; so much
only being known that the Indian <i>Discognathus lamta</i> occurs in
the reservoirs of Aden, having, moreover, found its way to the opposite
African coast; and that the ubiquitous Cyprinodonts flourish in
brackish pools of Northern Arabia.</p>

<p>The following is the list of the forms of freshwater fishes inhabiting
this region:<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>—</p>

<p>In analysing this list we find that out of 39 families or groups of
freshwater fishes 12 are represented in this region, and that 625
species are known to occur in it; a number equal to two-sevenths of
the entire number of freshwater fishes known. This large proportion
is principally due to the development of numerous local forms of
Siluroids and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span> Cyprinoids, of which the former show a contingent
of about 200, and the latter of about 330 species. The combined
development of those two families, and their undue preponderance over
the other freshwater types, is therefore the principal characteristic
of the Indian region. The second important character of its fauna is
the apparently total absence of Ganoid and Cyclostomous fishes. Every
other region has representatives of either Ganoids or Cyclostomes,
some of both. However, attention has been directed to the remarkable
coincidence of the geographical distribution of the <i>Sirenidæ</i>
and <i>Osteoglossidæ</i>, and as the latter family is represented in
Sumatra and Borneo, it may be reasonably expected that a Dipnoous form
will be found to accompany it. The distribution of the <i>Sirenidæ</i>
and <i>Osteoglossidæ</i> is as follows:—</p>

<p>Not only are the corresponding species found within the same region,
but also in the same river systems; and although such a connection
may and must be partly due to a similarity of habit, yet the identity
of this singular distribution is so striking that it can only be
accounted for by assuming that the <i>Osteoglossidæ</i> are one of the
earliest Teleosteous types which have been contemporaries of and have
accompanied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span> the present Dipnoi since or even before the beginning of
the tertiary epoch.</p>

<p>Of the <i>autochthont</i> freshwater fishes of the Indian region,
some are still limited to it, viz., the <i>Nandina</i>, the
<i>Luciocephalidæ</i> (of which one species only exists in the
Archipelago), of Siluroids the <i>Chacina</i> and <i>Bagariina</i>,
of Cyprinoids the <i>Semiplotina</i> and <i>Homalopterina</i>; others
very nearly so, like the <i>Labyrinthici</i>, <i>Ophiocephalidæ</i>,
<i>Mastacembelidæ</i>, of Siluroids the <i>Silurina</i>, of Cyprinoids
the <i>Rasborina</i> and <i>Danionina</i>, and <i>Symbranchidæ</i>.</p>

<p>The regions with which the Indian has least similarity are the North
American and Antarctic, as they are the most distant. Its affinity to
the other regions is of a very different degree:—</p>

<p>1. Its affinity to the Europo-Asiatic region is indicated almost
solely by three groups of Cyprinoids, viz., the <i>Cyprinina</i>,
<i>Abramidina</i>, and <i>Cobitidina</i>. The development of these
groups north and south of the Himalayas is due to their common origin
in the highlands of Asia; but the forms which descended into the
tropical climate of the south are now so distinct from their northern
brethren that most of them are referred to distinct genera. The genera
which are still common to both regions are only the true Barbels
(<i>Barbus</i>), a genus which, of all Cyprinoids, has the largest
range over the old world, and of which some 160 species have been
described; and, secondly, the Mountain Barbels (<i>Schizothorax</i>,
etc.), which, peculiar to the Alpine waters of Central Asia, descend
a short distance only towards the tropical plains, but extend farther
into rivers within the northern temperate districts. The origin and the
laws of the distribution of the <i>Cobitidina</i> appear to have been
identical with those of <i>Barbus</i>, but they have not spread into
Africa.</p>

<p>If, in determining the degree of affinity between two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span> regions, we take
into consideration the extent in which an exchange has taken place of
the faunæ originally peculiar to each, we must estimate that obtaining
between the freshwater fishes of the Europo-Asiatic and Indian regions
as very slight indeed.</p>

<p>2. There exists a great affinity between the Indian and African
regions; seventeen out of the twenty-six families or groups found
in the former are represented by one or more species in Africa,
and many of the African species are not even generically different
from the Indian. As the majority of these groups have many more
representatives in India than in Africa, we may reasonably assume that
the African species have been derived from the Indian stock; but this
is probably not the case with the Siluroid group of <i>Clariina</i>,
which with regard to species is nearly equally distributed between
the two regions, the African species being referable to three genera
(<i>Clarias</i>, <i>Heterobranchus</i>, <i>Gymnallabes</i>, with
the subgenus <i>Channallabes</i>), whilst the Indian species belong
to two genera only, viz. <i>Clarias</i> and <i>Heterobranchus</i>.
On the other hand, the Indian region has derived from Africa one
freshwater form only, viz. <i>Etroplus</i>, a member of the family
of <i>Chromides</i>, so well represented in tropical Africa and
South America. <i>Etroplus</i> inhabits Southern and Western India
and Ceylon, and has its nearest ally in a Madegasse Freshwater fish,
<i>Paretroplus</i>. Considering that other African Chromides have
acclimatised themselves at the present day in saline water, we think it
more probable that Etroplus should have found its way to India through
the ocean than over the connecting land area; where, besides, it does
not occur.</p>

<p>3. A closer affinity between the Indian and Tropical American regions
than is indicated by the character of the equatorial zone generally,
does not exist. No genus of Freshwater fishes occurs in India and
South America without being found in the intermediate African region,
with two exceptions.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span> Four small Indian Siluroids (<i>Sisor</i>,
<i>Erethistes</i>, <i>Pseudecheneis</i>, and <i>Exostoma</i>) have been
referred to the South American <i>Hypostomatina</i>; but it remains to
be seen whether this combination is based upon a sufficient agreement
of their internal structure, or whether it is not rather artificial.
On the other hand, the occurrence and wide distribution in tropical
America of a fish of the Indian family Symbranchidæ (<i>Symbranchus
marmoratus</i>), which is not only congeneric with, but also most
closely allied to, the Indian <i>Symbranchus bengalensis</i>, offers
one of those extraordinary anomalies in the distribution of animals of
which no satisfactory explanation can be given at present.</p>

<p>4. The relation of the Indian region to the Tropical Pacific region
consists only in its having contributed a few species to the poor
fauna of the latter. This immigration must have taken place within
a recent period, because some species now inhabit fresh waters of
tropical Australia and the South Sea Islands without having in any
way changed their specific characters, as <i>Lates calcarifer</i>,
species of <i>Dules</i>, <i>Plotosus anguillaris</i>; others (species
of <i>Arius</i>) are but little different from Indian congeners. All
these fishes must have migrated by the sea; a supposition which is
supported by what we know of their habits. We need not add that India
has not received a single addition to its freshwater fish-fauna from
the Pacific region.</p>

<p>Before concluding these remarks on the Indian region, we must mention
that peculiar genera of Cyprinoids and Siluroids inhabit the streams
and lakes of its alpine ranges in the north. Some of them, like
the Siluroid genera <i>Glyptosternum</i>, <i>Euglyptosternum</i>,
<i>Pseudecheneis</i>, have a folded disk on the thorax between their
horizontally spread pectoral fins; by means of this they adhere
to stones at the bottom of the mountain torrents, and without it
they would be swept away into the lower courses of the rivers.
The Cyprinoid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span> genera inhabiting similar localities, and the
lakes into which the alpine rivers pass, such as <i>Oreinus</i>,
<i>Schizothorax</i>, <i>Ptychobarbus</i>, <i>Schizopygopsis</i>,
<i>Diptychus</i>, <i>Gymnocypris</i>, are distinguished by peculiarly
enlarged scales near the vent, the physiological use of which has
not yet been ascertained. These alpine genera extend far into the
Europo-Asiatic region, where the climate is similar to that of their
southern home. No observations have been made by which the altitudinal
limits of fish life in the Himalayas can be fixed, but it is probable
that it reaches the line of perpetual snow, as in the European Alps
which are inhabited by Salmonoids. Griffith found an <i>Oreinus</i>
and a Loach, the former in abundance, in the Helmund at Gridun Dewar,
altitude 10,500 feet; and another Loach at Kaloo at 11,000 feet.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>B. <span class="smcap">The African Region</span> comprises the whole of the African
continent south of the Atlas and the Sahara. It might have been
conjectured that the more temperate climate of its southern extremity
would have been accompanied by a conspicuous difference of the
fish-fauna. But this is not the case; the difference between the
tropical and southern parts of Africa consists simply in the gradual
disappearance of specifically tropical forms, whilst Siluroids,
Cyprinoids, and even Labyrinthici penetrate to its southern coast;
no new form has entered to impart to South Africa a character
distinct from the central portion of the continent. In the north-east
the African fauna passes the Isthmus of Suez and penetrates into
Syria; the system of the Jordan presenting so many African types
that it has to be included in a description of the African region
as well as of the Europo-Asiatic. This river is inhabited by three
species of <i>Chromis</i>, one of <i>Hemichromis</i>, and <i>Clarias
macracanthus</i>, a common fish of the Upper Nile. This infusion of
African forms cannot be accounted for by any one of those accidental
means of dispersal,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span> as <i>Hemichromis</i> is not represented in the
north-eastern parts of Africa proper, but chiefly on the west coast and
in the Central African lakes.</p>

<p>Madagascar clearly belongs to this region. Besides some Gobies
and <i>Dules</i>, which are not true freshwater fishes, four
<i>Chromides</i> are known. To judge from general accounts, its
Freshwater fauna is poorer than might be expected; but, singular as it
may appear, collectors have hitherto paid but little attention to the
Freshwater fishes of this island. The fishes found in the freshwaters
of the Seychelles and Mascarenes are brackish-water fishes, such as
<i>Fundulus</i>, <i>Haplochilus</i>, <i>Elops</i>, <i>Mugil</i>, etc.</p>

this region:—</p>

<p>Out of the 39 families or groups of freshwater fishes 15 are
represented in the African region, or three more than in the Indian
region; however of two of them, viz., the <i>Ophiocephalidæ</i> and
<i>Mastacembelidæ</i>, a few species only have found their way into
Africa. On the other hand, the number of species is much less, viz.
255, which is only two-fifths of that of the known Indian species. The
small degree of specialisation and localisation is principally due to
the greater uniformity of the physical conditions of this continent,
and to the almost perfect continuity of the great river systems,
which take their origin from the lakes in its centre. This is best
shown by a comparison of the fauna of the Upper Nile with that of the
West African rivers. The number of species known from the Upper Nile
amounts to 56, and of these not less than 25 are absolutely identical
with West African species. There is an uninterrupted continuity of the
fish-fauna from west to the north-east, and the species known to be
common to both extremities may be reasonably assumed to inhabit also
the great reservoirs of water in the centre of the continent. A greater
dissimilarity is noticeable between the west and north-east fauna
on the one hand, and that of the Zambezi on the other; the affinity
between them is merely generic; and all the fishes hitherto collected
in Lake Nyassa have proved to be distinct from those of the Nile, and
even from those of other parts of the system of the Zambezi.</p>

<p>Africa, unlike India, does not possess either alpine ranges or outlying
archipelagoes, the fresh waters of which would swell the number of its
indigenous species; but at a future time, when its fauna is better
known than at present, it is possible that the great difference in the
number of species between this and the Indian regions may be somewhat
lessened.</p>

<p>The most numerously-represented families are the Siluroids, with
61 species; the Cyprinoids, with 52; the Mormyridæ, with 51; the
Characinidæ, with 35; and the Chromides,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span> with 29. There is not,
therefore, that great preponderance of the two first families over the
remaining, which we noticed in the Indian region; in Africa there is a
comparatively greater variety of distinct Freshwater types, imparting
to the study of its fauna an unflagging pleasure such as is scarcely
gained by the study of the other region. With the forms peculiar to it
there are combined those of India as well as South America.</p>

<p>In Tropical Africa there are still remnants of Ganoids:
<i>Protopterus</i> (<i>Lepidosiren</i>) <i>annectens</i>
and <i>Polypterus bichir</i>, with the singularly modified
<i>Calamoichthys</i>. The two former range from east to west, and are
accompanied by an Osteoglossoid (<i>Heterotis</i>) which has hitherto
been found in the Nile and on the West Coast only.</p>

<p>Autochthont and limited to this region are the <i>Mormyridæ</i>,
<i>Pantodontidæ</i>, and <i>Kneriidæ</i>, a singular type,
somewhat akin to the Loaches. Of Siluroid genera the most
characteristic are <i>Synodontis</i>, <i>Rhinoglanis</i>, and the
electric <i>Malapterurus</i>; of Characinoids, <i>Citharinus</i>,
<i>Alestes</i>, <i>Xenocharax</i>, <i>Hydrocyon</i>,
<i>Distichodon</i>, <i>Ichthyborus</i>.</p>

<p>The regions with which Africa (like India) has least similarity
are, again, the North American and Antarctic. Its affinity with the
Europe-Asiatic region consists only in having received, like this
latter, a branch of the Cyprinoids, the African Carps and Barbels
resembling, on the whole, more Indian than Europo-Asiatic forms. Its
similarity to Australia is limited to the two regions possessing
Dipnoous and Osteoglossoid types. But its relations to the two other
regions of the equatorial zone are near and of great interest.</p>

<p>1. Africa has, in common with India, the Siluroid group of
<i>Clariina</i>, the <i>Silurina</i>, and <i>Bagrina</i>; and more
especially the small but very natural family of <i>Notopteridæ</i>,
represented by three species in India, and by two on the <i>west
coast</i> of Africa. It would be hazardous to state at present in
which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span> of the two regions these fishes first made their appearance,
but the discovery of remains of <i>Notopteridæ</i> and <i>Silurina</i>
in tertiary deposits of Sumatra points to the Indian region as their
original home. We can have less doubt about the other fishes common to
both regions; they are clearly immigrants into Africa from the East,
and it is a remarkable fact that these immigrants have penetrated
to the most distant limits of Africa in the west as well as in the
south,—viz. the <i>Labyrinthici</i>, represented by two genera closely
allied to the Indian <i>Anabas</i>; the <i>Ophiocephalidæ</i> and
<i>Mastacembelidæ</i>, a few species of which have penetrated to the
west coast, singularly enough being absent from the eastern rivers;
the <i>Ariina</i>, represented by several species, of which one or
two are identical with Indian, having extended their range along the
intervening coasts to the east coast of Africa. The Cyprinoids also
afford an instance of an Indian species ranging into Africa, viz.
<i>Discognathus lamta</i>, which seems to have crossed at the southern
extremity of the Red Sea, as it is found in the reservoirs at Aden and
the hill-streams of the opposite coast-region of Abyssinia.</p>

<p>2. No such direct influx of species and genera has occurred from
South America into Africa. Yet the affinity of their Freshwater
fishes is striking. Two of the most natural families of fishes, the
<i>Chromides</i> and <i>Characinidæ</i>, are peculiar, and (with
the exception of <i>Etroplus</i>) restricted to them. The African
and South American Dipnoi are closely allied to each other. The
<i>Pimelodina</i>, so characteristic of Tropical America, have three
representatives in Africa, viz., <i>Pimelodus platychir</i>, <i>P.
balayi</i>, and <i>Auchenoglanis biscutatus</i>; the <i>Doradina</i>
are another Siluroid group restricted to these two continents.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
Yet, with all these points of close resemblance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span> the African and
South American series are, with the exception of the two species of
Pimelodus, <i>generically</i> distinct; which shows that the separation
of the continents must have been of an old date. On the other hand,
the existence of so many similar forms on both sides of the Atlantic
affords much support to the supposition that at a former period the
distance between the present Atlantic continents was much less, and
that the fishes which have diverged towards the East and West are
descendants of a common stock which had its home in a region now
submerged under some intervening part of that ocean. Be this as it
may, it is evident that the physical conditions of Africa and South
America have remained unchanged for a considerable period, and are
still sufficiently alike to preserve the identity of a number of
peculiar freshwater forms on both sides of the Atlantic. Africa and
South America are, moreover, the only continents which have produced in
Freshwater fishes, though in very different families, one of the most
extraordinary modifications of an organ—the conversion, that is, of
muscle into an apparatus creating electric force.</p>

<p>C. The boundaries of the <span class="smcap">Tropical American</span>
(<i>Neotropical</i>) <span class="smcap">Region</span> have been sufficiently indicated
in the definition of the Equatorial zone. A broad and most irregular
band of country, in which the South and North American forms are mixed,
exists in the north; offering some peculiarities which deserve fuller
attention in the subsequent description of the relations between the
South and North American faunæ. The following Freshwater fishes inhabit
this region:—</p>

<p>Out of the 39 families or groups of Freshwater fishes, 9 only are
represented in the Tropical American region. This may be accounted for
by the fact that South America is too much isolated from the other
regions of the Equatorial zone to have received recent additions to
its fauna. On the other hand, the number of species exceeds that of
every other region, even of the Indian, with which, in regard to the
comparative development of families, the Neotropical region shows great
analogy, as will be seen from the following Table:—</p>

<p>In both regions the great number of species is due to the development
of numerous local forms of two families, the <i>Characinidæ</i> taking
in the New World the place of the <i>Cyprinidæ</i> of the Old World.
Thereto are added a few smaller families with a moderately large number
of species, which, however, is only a fraction of that of the leading
families, the remainder of the families being represented by a few
species only. The number of genera within each of the two regions of
the two principal families is also singularly alike; the Indian region
having produced about 45 Siluroid and as many Cyprinoid genera, whilst
the Neotropical region is tenanted by 54 Siluroid and 40 Characinoid
genera. These points of similarity between the two regions cannot
be accidental; they indicate that agreement in their physical and
hydrographical features which in reality exists.</p>

<p>Of Ganoids, we find in Tropical America one species only,
<i>Lepidosiren paradoxa</i>, accompanied by two Osteoglossoids
(<i>Osteoglossum bicirrhosum</i> and <i>Arapaima gigas</i>).</p>

<p>Autochthont and limited to this region are the <i>Polycentridæ</i>,
all the non-African genera of <i>Chromides</i> and <i>Characinidæ</i>;
of Siluroids, the <i>Hypophthalmina</i>, <i>Aspredinina</i>,
and <i>Stegophilina</i>, and the majority of <i>Pimelodina</i>,
<i>Hypostomatina</i>, and <i>Doradina</i>; the herbivorous Cyprinodonts
or <i>Limnophagæ</i>, and numerous insectivorous Cyprinodonts or
<i>Carnivoræ</i>; and the <i>Gymnotidæ</i> (Electric eel).</p>

<p>The relations to the other regions are as follows:—</p>

<p>1. The resemblances to the Indian and Tropical Pacific regions partly
date from remote geological epochs, or are partly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span> due to that
similarity of physical conditions to which we have already referred.
We have again to draw attention to the unexplained presence in South
America of a representative of a truly Indian type (not found in
Africa), viz. <i>Symbranchus marmoratus</i>. On the other hand, a
direct genetic affinity exists between the Neotropical and African
regions, as has been noticed in the description of the latter, a great
part of their freshwater fauna consisting of descendants from a common
stock.</p>

<p>2. A comparison of the specifically Neotropical with the specifically
North American types shows that no two regions can be more dissimilar.
It is only in the intervening borderland, and in the large West Indian
Islands, that the two faunæ mix with each other. We need not enter into
the details of the physical features of Central America and Mexico—the
broken ground, the variety of climate (produced by different altitudes)
within limited districts, the hot and moist alluvial plains surrounding
the Mexican Gulf, offer a diversity of conditions most favourable to
the intermixture of the types from the north and the south. But yet
the exchange of peculiar forms appears to be only beginning; none have
yet penetrated beyond the debatable ground, and it is evident that the
land-connection between the two continents is of comparatively recent
date: a view which is confirmed by the identity of the marine fishes on
both sides of Central America.</p>

<p>Cuba—and this is the only island in the West Indies which has a
number of freshwater fishes sufficient for the determination of its
zoo-geographical relations—is inhabited by several kinds of a perch
(<i>Centropomus</i>), freshwater mullets, Cyprinodonts, one species
of Chromid (an <i>Acara</i>), and <i>Symbranchus marmoratus</i>. All
these fishes are found in Central America, and as they belong to forms
known to enter brackish water more or less freely, it is evident that
they have crossed from the mainland of South America or from Central<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
America. But with them there came a remarkable North American type,
<i>Lepidosteus</i>. <i>Lepidosteus viridis</i>, which is found in the
United States, has penetrated on the mainland to the Pacific coast
of Guatemala, where it is common at the mouth of the rivers and in
brack-water lakes along the coast; it probably crossed into Cuba from
Florida. A perfectly isolated type of fishes inhabits the subterranean
waters of the caves of Cuba (two species of <i>Lucifuga</i>). The
eyes are absent or quite rudimentary, as in most other cave animals.
Singularly, it belongs to a family (<i>Ophidiidæ</i>), the members
of which are strictly marine; and its nearest ally is a genus,
<i>Brotula</i>, the species of which are distributed over the
Indo-Pacific Ocean, one only occurring in the Caribbean Sea. This type
must have witnessed all the geological changes which have taken place
since Cuba rose above the surface of the sea.</p>

<p>A similar mixture of forms of the Tropical and Temperate types of
Freshwater fishes takes place in the south of South America; its
details have not yet been so well studied as in the north; but this
much is evident that, whilst in the East Tropical forms follow the
Plate river far into the Temperate region, in the West the Temperate
Fauna finds still a congenial climate in ranges of the Andes, situated
close to, or even north of, the Tropic.</p>

<p>Like the Indian region, the Tropical American has a peculiar Alpine
Fauna, the Freshwater fishes of which, however, belong to the
Siluroids and Cyprinodonts. The former are small, dwarfed forms
(<i>Arges</i>, <i>Stygogenes</i>, <i>Brontes</i>, <i>Astroblepus</i>,
<i>Trichomycterus</i>, <i>Eremophilus</i>), and have a perfectly
naked body, whilst the representatives in the lowlands of, at least,
the first four genera are mailed. The Alpine Cyprinodonts, on the
other hand, (<i>Orestias</i>) exceed the usual small size of the
other members of this family, are covered with thick scales, but
have lost their ventral fins. Some of these Alpine forms, like
<i>Trichomycterus</i>, follow the range of the Andes far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span> into the
southern temperate region. The majority reach to a height of 15,000
feet above the level of the sea, and a few are found still higher.</p>

<p>D. The <span class="smcap">Tropical Pacific Region</span> includes all the islands east
of Wallace’s Line, New Guinea, Australia—with the exception of its
south-eastern portion,—and all the islands of the Tropical Pacific to
the Sandwich group. Comparing the area of this region with that of the
others, we find it to be not only the poorest in point of the number of
its species generally, but also in that of the possession of peculiar
forms, as will appear from the following list:—</p>

<p>The paucity of freshwater fishes is due, in the first place, to the
arid climate and the deficiency of water in the Australian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span> continent,
as well as to the insignificant size of the freshwater courses in
the smaller islands. Still this cannot be the only cause: the large
island of Celebes, which, by its mountainous portions, as well as by
its extensive plains and lowlands, would seem to offer a favourable
variety of conditions for the development of a freshwater Fauna is,
as far as has been ascertained, tenanted by seven Freshwater fishes
only, viz. 2 <i>Arius</i>, 2 <i>Plotosus</i>, 1 <i>Andbas</i>, 1
<i>Ophiocephalus</i>, 1 <i>Monopterus</i>, all of which are the
commonest species of the Indian region. New Guinea has not yet been
explored, but, from the faunæ nearest to this island, we expect its
freshwater fishes will prove to be equally few in number, and identical
with those of Celebes and North Australia; a supposition confirmed by
the few small collections which have reached Europe. Finding, then,
that even those parts of this region, which are favourable to the
development of Freshwater fishes, have not produced any distinct forms,
and that the few species which inhabit them, are unchanged, or but
slightly modified Indian species, we must conclude that the whole of
this area has remained geologically isolated from the other regions of
this zone since the commencement of the existence of Teleostei; and
that, with the exception of <i>Ceratodus</i> and <i>Osteoglossum</i>,
the immigration of the other species is of very recent date.</p>

<p>Fossil remains of <i>Ceratodus</i> have been found in Liassic and
Triassic formations of North America, England, Germany, and India;
and it is, therefore, a type which was widely spread in the Mesozoic
epoch. Although it would be rash to conclude that its occupation
of Australia dates equally far back, for it may have reached that
continent long afterwards; yet it is evident that, as it is one of the
most ancient of the existing types, so it is certainly the first of the
Freshwater fishes which appeared in Australia. <i>Osteoglossum</i>,
of which no fossil remains yet have been found, is proved by its
distribution<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span> to be one of the oldest Teleosteous types. There must
have been a long gap of time before these ancient types were joined
by the other Teleostei. All of them migrated through the intervening
parts of the ocean from India. Most of the <i>Plotosina</i>, some of
the <i>Arii</i>, <i>Dules</i>, and the <i>Atherinichthys</i>, also
<i>Nannoperca</i> (allied to <i>Apogon</i>), were among the earliest
arrivals, being sufficiently differentiated to be specifically or even
generically (<i>Cnidoglanis</i>, <i>Nannoperca</i>) distinguished; but
some others, like <i>Anabas scandens</i>, <i>Lates calcarifer</i>,
<i>Dules marginatus</i>, must have reached the Australian continent
quite recently, for they are indistinguishable from Indian specimens.</p>

<p>In South-western Australia a mingling of the scanty fauna with that of
the southern temperate parts takes place. <i>Oligorus macquariensis</i>
(The Murray Cod), which has a congener on the coast of New Zealand,
ascends high up the Murray river, so that we cannot decide whether
this Percoid should be located in the Tropical or Temperate part of
Australia. Several <i>Galaxias</i> also extend to the confines of
Queensland, and will probably some day be found members of this region.</p>

<p>In the smaller Pacific islands the Freshwater fishes exhibit a
remarkable sameness: two or three species of <i>Dules</i>, several
Eels, an Atherine, or some Gobies, Mullets, and other fishes which with
equal readiness exchange fresh for salt water, and which would at once
reach and occupy any streams or freshwater lakes that may be formed on
an island.</p>

<p>The Sandwich Islands are the only group among the smaller islands which
are tenanted by a Siluroid, a species of <i>Arius</i>, which is closely
allied to Central American species, and, therefore, probably immigrated
from Tropical America.</p>


<h3>II. <span class="smcap">Northern Zone.</span></h3>

<p>The boundaries of the Northern Zone coincide in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span> main with
the northern limit of the Equatorial Zone; but at three different
points they overlap the latter, as has been already indicated.
This happens in, and east of, Syria, where the mixed faunæ of the
Jordan and the rivers of Mesopotamia demand the inclusion of this
territory into the Northern Zone as well as the Equatorial; in the
island of Formosa, where a Salmonoid and several Japanese Cyprinoids
flourish; and in Central America, where a <i>Lepidosteus</i>, a
Cyprinoid (<i>Sclerognathus meridionalis</i>), and an Amiurus (<i>A.
meridionalis</i>) represent the North American fauna in the midst of a
host of tropical forms.</p>

<p>A separate <i>Arctic</i> Zone does not exist for Freshwater fishes;
ichthyic life becomes extinct towards the pole as soon as the fresh
water remains frozen throughout the year, or thaws for a few weeks
only; and the few fishes which extend into high latitudes, in which
lakes are open for two or three months in the year, belong to types in
no wise differing from those of the more temperate south. The highest
latitude at which fishes have been obtained is 82° lat. N., whence
the late Arctic Expedition brought back specimens of Charr (<i>Salmo
arcturus</i> and <i>Salmo naresii</i>).</p>

<p>The ichthyological features of this zone are well marked:
the Chondrosteous Ganoids or Sturgeons, and the families of
<i>Salmonidæ</i> and <i>Esocidæ</i> are limited to, and characteristic
of, it; Cyprinoids flourish with the Salmonoids, both families
preponderating in numbers over the others, whilst the Siluroids are few
in number and in variety.</p>

<p>The two regions in which this zone is divided are very closely related
to one another, and their affinity is not unlike that which obtains
between the sub-regions of the Southern Zone. The subjoined list
will show their close agreement with regard to families as well as
species. Several of the latter are common to both, viz.—<i>Acipenser
sturio</i>, <i>A. maculatu</i>s, <i>Perca fluviatilis</i>,
<i>Gastrosteus pungitius</i>, <i>Salmo salar</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span> <i>Esox lucius</i>,
<i>Lota vulgaris</i>, <i>Petromyzon marinus</i>, <i>P. fluviatilis</i>,
and <i>P. branchialis</i>; and all recent investigations have resulted
in giving additional evidence of the affinity, and not of the diversity
of the two regions.</p>

<p>In Europe and temperate Asia, as well as in North America, mountain
ranges elevated beyond the line of perpetual snow would seem to offer
physical conditions favourable for the development of a distinct
alpine fauna. But this is not the case, because the difference of
climate between the mountain districts and the lowlands is much less in
this zone than in the Equatorial. Consequently the alpine freshwater
fishes do not essentially differ from those of the plains; they are
principally Salmonoids; and in Asia, besides, mountain-barbels and
Loaches. <i>Salmo orientalis</i> was found by Griffith to abound in the
tributaries of the Bamean river at an altitude of about 11,000 feet.</p>

<p>A. <span class="smcap">The Europo-Asiatic (Palæarctic) Region.</span>—Its western and
southern boundaries coincide with those of the Northern Zone, so that
only those which divide it from North America have to be indicated.
Behring’s Strait and the Kamtschatka Sea have been conventionally
taken as the boundary, but this is shown to be artificial by the fact
that the animals of both coasts, as far as they are known at present,
are not sufficiently distinct to be referred to two distinct regions.
As to the freshwater fishes those of North-western America and of
Kamtschatka are but imperfectly known, but there can be little doubt
that the same agreement exists between them as is the case with other
classes of animals. The Japanese islands exhibit a decided Palæarctic
fish-fauna, which includes Barbus and Cobitioids, forms strange to the
North American fauna. A slight influx of tropical forms is perceived in
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span> south of Japan, where two Bagrina (<i>Pseudobagrus aurantiacus</i>
and <i>Liocassis longirostris</i>) have established themselves for a
considerable period, for both are peculiar to the island, and have not
been found elsewhere.</p>

<p>In the east, as well as in the west, the distinction between the
Europo-Asiatic and North American regions disappears almost entirely
the farther we advance towards the north. Of four species of the genus
Salmo known from Iceland, one (<i>S. salar</i>) is common to both
regions, two are European (<i>S. fario</i> and <i>S. alpinus</i>), and
one is a peculiarly Icelandic race (<i>S. nivalis</i>). As far as we
know the Salmonoids of Greenland and Baffin’s Land they are all most
closely allied to European species, though they may be distinguished as
local races.</p>

<p>Finally, as we have seen above, the Europo-Asiatic fauna mingles
with African and Indian forms in Syria, Persia, and Afghanistan.
<i>Capoëta</i>, a Cyprinoid genus, is characteristic of this district,
and well represented in the Jordan and rivers of Mesopotamia.</p>

<p>Assuming that the distribution of Cyprinoids has taken its origin from
the alpine tract of country dividing the Indian and Palæarctic regions,
we find that this type has found in the temperate region as equally
favourable conditions for its development as in the tropical. Out of
the 360 species known to exist in the Palæarctic regions, no less than
215 are Cyprinoids. In the countries and on the plateaus immediately
joining the Himalayan ranges those mountain forms which we mentioned
as peculiar to the Indian Alps abound and extend for a considerable
distance towards the west and east, mixed with other <i>Cyprinina</i>
and <i>Cobitidina</i>. The representatives of these two groups are
more numerous in Central and Eastern Asia than in Europe and the
northern parts of Asia, where the <i>Leuciscina</i> predominate.
<i>Abramidina</i> or Breams are more numerous in the south and east
of Asia, but they spread to the extreme north-western and northern
limits, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span> which the Cyprinoid type reaches. The <i>Rhodeina</i> are
a small family especially characteristic of the East, but with one or
two off-shoots in Central Europe. Very significant is the appearance in
China of a species of the <i>Catostomina</i>, a group otherwise limited
to North America.</p>

<p>The Cyprinoids, in their dispersal from the south northwards, are
met from the opposite direction by the Salmonoids. These fishes are,
without doubt, one of the youngest families of <i>Teleostei</i>, for
they did not appear before the Pliocene era; they flourished at any
rate during the glacial period, and, as is testified by the remnants
which we find in isolated elevated positions, like the Trout of the
Atlas, of the mountains of Asia-Minor, and of the Hindu Kush, they
spread to the extreme south of this region. At the present day they are
most numerously represented in its northern temperate parts; towards
the south they become scarcer, but increase again in numbers and
species, wherever a great elevation offers them the snow-fed waters
which they affect. In the rivers of the Mediterranean Salmonoids are by
no means scarce, but they prefer the upper courses of those rivers, and
do not migrate to the sea.</p>

<p>The Pike, Umbra, several species of Perch and Stickleback, are also
clearly autochthont species of this region. Others belong to marine
types, and seem to have been retained in fresh water at various
epochs: thus the freshwater Cottus (Miller’s Thumb); <i>Cottus
quadricornis</i>, which inhabits lakes of Scandinavia, whilst other
individuals of the same species are strictly marine; the Burbot
(<i>Lota vulgaris</i>); and the singular <i>Comephorus</i>, a dwarfed
and much-changed Gadoid which inhabits the greatest depths of Lake
Baikal.</p>

<p>Remnants of the Palæichthyic fauna are the <i>Sturgeons</i> and
<i>Lampreys</i>. The former inhabit in abundance the great rivers of
Eastern Europe and Asia, periodically ascending them from the sea;
their southernmost limits are the Yangtse-kiang<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span> in the east, and
rivers flowing into the Adriatic, Black and Caspian Seas, and Lake
Aral, towards the centre of this region. None are known to have gone
beyond the boundaries of the Northern Zone. If the Lampreys are justly
reckoned among Freshwater fishes, their distribution is unique and
exceptional. In the Palæarctic region some of the species descend
periodically to the sea, whilst others remain stationary in the rivers;
the same has been observed in the Lampreys of North America. They are
entirely absent in the Equatorial Zone, but reappear in the Temperate
Zone of the Southern Hemisphere. Many points of the organisation of the
Cyclostomes indicate that they are a type of great antiquity.</p>

<p>The remaining Palæarctic fishes are clearly immigrants from
neighbouring regions: thus <i>Silurus</i>, <i>Macrones</i>, and
<i>Pseudobagrus</i> from the Indian region; <i>Amiurus</i> (and,
as mentioned above, <i>Catostomus</i>) from North America. The
Cyprinodonts are restricted to the southern and warmer parts; all
belong to the carnivorous division. The facility with which these
fishes accommodate themselves to a sojourn in fresh, brackish, or salt
water, and even in thermal springs, renders their general distribution
easily comprehensible, but it is impossible to decide to which region
they originally belonged; their remains in tertiary deposits round the
Mediterranean are not rare.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>B</i>. The boundaries of the <span class="smcap">North American</span> or <span class="smcap">Nearctic
Region</span> have been sufficiently indicated. The main features and the
distribution of this fauna are identical with those of the preceding
region. The proportion of Cyprinoid species to the total number of
North-American fishes (135:339) appears to be considerably less than in
the Palæarctic region, but we cannot admit that these figures approach
the truth, as the Cyprinoids of North America have been much less<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
studied than those of Europe; of many scarcely more than the name is
known. This also applies in a great measure to the Salmonoids, of which
only half as many as are found in the Palæarctic region have been
sufficiently described to be worthy of consideration. North America
will, without doubt, in the end show as many distinct races as Europe
and Asia.</p>

<p>Cyprinoids, belonging to genera living as well as extinct, existed in
North America in the tertiary period. At present, <i>Cyprinina</i>,
<i>Leuciscina</i>, and <i>Abramidina</i> are well represented, but
there is no representative of the Old World genus <i>Barbus</i>,
or of the <i>Cobitidina</i><a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>; <i>Rhodeina</i> are also absent.
On the other hand, a well-marked Cyprinoid type is developed—the
<i>Catostomina</i>, of which one species has, as it were, returned
into Asia. Very characteristic is the group of <i>Centrarchina</i>,
allied to the Perch, of which there are some thirty species; two
<i>Grystina</i>. Of the Sticklebacks there are as many species
as in Europe, and of Pike not less than seven species have been
distinguished. <i>Umbra</i> appears to be as local as in Europe. Some
very remarkable forms, types of distinct families, though represented
by one or two species only, complete the number of North American
autochthont fishes—viz., <i>Aphredoderus</i>, <i>Percopsis</i>,
<i>Hyodon</i>, and the <i>Heteropygii</i> (<i>Amblyopsis</i> and
<i>Chologaster</i>). The last are allied to the Cyprinodonts, differing
from them in some points of the structure of their intestines. The two
genera are extremely similar, but <i>Chologaster</i>, which is found
in ditches of the rice-fields of South Carolina, is provided with
eyes, and lacks the ventral fins. <i>Amblyopsis</i> is the celebrated
Blind Fish of the Mammoth Cave of Kentucky: colourless, eyeless, with
rudimentary ventral fins, which may be occasionally entirely absent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span></p>

<p>A peculiar feature of the North American Fish Fauna is that it has
retained, besides the Sturgeons and Lampreys, representatives of two
Ganoid families, <i>Lepidosteus</i> and <i>Amia</i>. Both these genera
existed in tertiary times: the former occurs in tertiary deposits of
Europe as well as North America, whilst fossil remains of <i>Amia</i>
have been found in the Western Hemisphere only.</p>

<p>It is difficult to account for the presence of the <i>Amiurina</i> in
North America. They form a well-marked division of the <i>Bagrina</i>,
which are well represented in Africa and the East Indies, but absent in
South America; it is evident, therefore, they should not be regarded
as immigrants from the south, as is the case with the Palæarctic
Siluroids. Nor, again, has the connection between South and North
America been established sufficiently long to admit of the supposition
that these Siluroids could have spread in the interval from the south
to the northern parts of the continent, for some of the species are
found as far north as Pine Islands Lake (54° lat. N.)<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>


<h3>III. <span class="smcap">Southern Zone.</span></h3>

<p>The boundaries of this zone have been indicated in the description of
the Equatorial Zone; they overlap the southern boundaries of the latter
in South Australia and South America, but we have not at present the
means of exactly defining the limits to which southern types extend
northwards. This zone includes Tasmania with at least a portion of
South-eastern Australia (<i>Tasmanian sub-region</i>), New Zealand
and the Auckland Islands (<i>New Zealand sub-region</i>), and Chili,
Patagonia, Terra del Fuego, and the Falkland Islands (<i>Fuegian
sub-region</i>). No freshwater fishes are known<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span> from Kerguelen’s Land,
or from islands beyond 55° lat. S. The southern extremity of Africa has
to be excluded from this zone so far as Freshwater fishes are concerned.</p>

<p>This zone is, with regard to its extent as well as to the number of
species, the smallest of the three; yet its ichthyological features
are well marked; they consist in the presence of two peculiar
families, each of which is analogous to a northern type, viz.
the <i>Haplochitonidæ</i>, which represent the <i>Salmonidæ</i>,
<i>Haplochiton</i> being the analogue of <i>Salmo</i>, and
<i>Prototroctes</i> that of <i>Coregonus</i>; and the <i>Galaxiidæ</i>,
which are the Pikes of the Southern Hemisphere.</p>

<p>Although geographically widely separate from each other, the Freshwater
fishes of the three divisions are nevertheless so closely allied
that conclusions drawn from this group of animals alone would hardly
justify us in regarding these divisions as sub-regions. One species of
<i>Galaxias</i> (<i>G. attenuatus</i>) and the three Lampreys are found
in all three, or at least two, sub-regions.</p>

<p>But little remains to be added in explanation of this list;
<i>Percichthys</i> is in Chili the autochthont form of the
cosmopolitan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span> group of <i>Percina</i>. <i>Diplomystax</i>, an Arioid
fish of Chili, and <i>Nematogenys</i> seem to have crossed the Andes
from Tropical America at a comparatively early period, as these
genera are not represented on the eastern side of South America; the
<i>Trichomycterina</i> occur on both sides of the Andes, which they
ascend to a considerable height. <i>Retropinna</i> is a true Salmonoid,
allied to, and representing in the Southern Hemisphere the Northern
Smelt, <i>Osmerus</i>. In both these genera a part of the specimens
live in the sea, and ascend rivers periodically to spawn; another part
remain in rivers and lakes, where they propagate, never descending
to the sea, this freshwater race being constantly smaller than their
marine brethren. That this small Teleostean of the Northern Hemisphere
should reappear, though in a generically modified form, in New Zealand,
without having spread over other parts of the Southern Zone, is one
of the most remarkable, and at present inexplicable facts of the
geographical distribution of freshwater fishes.</p>

<span class="subhed">THE FISHES OF THE BRACKISH WATER.</span></h2></div>

<p>On such parts of a coast at which there is a mixture of fresh and salt
water, either in consequence of some river emptying its water into the
sea or from an accumulation of land surface water forming lagunes,
which are in uninterrupted or temporary communication with the sea,
there flourishes a peculiar brackish water fauna which is characterised
by the presence of fishes found sometimes in sea-, sometimes in pure
freshwater.</p>

<p>This fauna can be rather sharply defined if a limited district only
is taken into consideration; thus, the species of the brackish water
fauna of Great Britain, the Pacific coast of Central America, of
the larger East India Islands, etc., can be enumerated without much
hesitation. But difficulties arise when we attempt to generalise in the
enumeration of the forms referable to the brackish water fauna; because
the genera and families enumerated include certain species and genera
which have habituated themselves exclusively either to a freshwater or
marine existence; and, besides, because a species of fish may be at
one locality an inhabitant of brackish water, at another of the sea,
and at a third of fresh water. The circumstance that these fishes can
live in sea and fresh water has enabled them to spread readily over the
globe, a few only being limited to particular regions; therefore, for
the purposes of dividing the earth’s surface into natural zoological
regions the brackish water forms are useless. The following fishes may
be referred to this Fauna:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span></p>

<p>1. Species of <i>Rajidæ</i> (<i>Raja</i>, <i>Trygon</i>) prefer the
mouths of rivers, probably because the muddy or sandy bottom offers the
most suitable conditions for fishes which can feed on the bottom only;
such brackish water species belong chiefly to the Equatorial Zone, some
having taken up their abode entirely in fresh water (South American
Trygons).</p>

<p>2. <i>Ambassis</i>, a Percoid genus, consisting of numerous small
species, inhabiting the shores of the tropical parts of the Indian
Ocean and the coasts of Tropical Australia. Many species enter, and all
seek the neighbourhood of, fresh water; hence they disappear in the
islands of the Pacific, and are scarce in the Red Sea.</p>

<p>3. <i>Therapon</i>, with the same distribution as the former.</p>

<p>4. Numerous <i>Sciænidæ</i> of the Equatorial Zone.</p>

<p>5. The <i>Polynemidæ</i>, chiefly inhabitants of brackish water of the
Equatorial Zone, most developed in the Indian region, and scarce in the
Tropical Pacific.</p>

<p>6. Numerous species of <i>Caranx</i> (or Horse Mackerels) of the
Equatorial Zone.</p>

<p>7. Nearly all species of <i>Gastrosteus</i> enter brackish water, <i>G.
spinachia</i> being almost exclusively confined to it: Northern Zone.</p>

<p>8. The most important genera of the Gobies (<i>Gobiina</i>):
<i>Gobius</i> (nearly cosmopolitan), <i>Sicydium</i>,
<i>Boleophthalmus</i>, <i>Periophthalmus</i>, <i>Eleotris</i>
(equatorial). Many of the species are entirely confined to fresh water.</p>

<p>9. The <i>Amblyopina</i>, similar to the Gobies, but with more
elongated body: Tropical Indo-Pacific.</p>

<p>10. The <i>Trypauchenina</i>: Coasts of the Indian region.</p>

<p>11. Many species of <i>Blennius</i>, of which several are found far
inland in fresh waters—for instance in North Italy, in the Lake of
Galilee, in the eastern parts of Asia Minor.</p>

<p>12. The majority of <i>Atherinidæ</i>, and</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span></p>

<p>13. The <i>Mugilidæ</i>: both families being most numerous and abundant
in brackish water, and almost cosmopolitan.</p>

<p>14. Many <i>Pleuronectidæ</i> prefer the mouths of rivers for the
same reason as the Rays; some ascend rivers, as the Flounder,
<i>Cynoglossus</i>, etc.</p>

<p>15. Several <i>Siluridæ</i>, as especially the genera <i>Plotosus</i>,
<i>Cnidoglanis</i>, <i>Arius</i>, which attain their greatest
development in brackish water.</p>

<p>16. The <i>Cyprinodontidæ</i> are frequently found in brackish water.</p>

<p>17. Species of <i>Clupea</i>, some of which ascend rivers, and become
acclimatized in fresh water, as <i>Clupea finta</i>, which has
established itself in the lakes of northern Italy.</p>

<p>18. <i>Chatoessus</i>, a genus of Clupeoid fishes of the Equatorial
Zone, of which some species have spread into the Northern Zone.</p>

<p>19. <i>Megalops</i>: Equatorial Zone.</p>

<p>20. <i>Anguilla.</i> The distribution, no less than the mode of
propagation, and the habits generally, of the so-called Freshwater-eels
still present us with many difficult problems. As far as we know
at present their birthplace seems to be the coast in the immediate
neighbourhood of the mouths of rivers. They are much more frequently
found in fresh water than in brackish water, but the distribution of
some species proves that they at times migrate by sea as well as by
land and river. Thus <i>Anguilla mauritiana</i> is found in almost
all the fresh and brackish waters of the islands of the Tropical
Indian Ocean and Western Pacific, from the Comoros to the South Sea;
<i>Anguilla vulgaris</i> is spread over temperate Europe (exclusive
of the system of the Danube, the Black and Caspian Seas), in the
Mediterranean district (including the Nile and rivers of Syria), and
on the Atlantic coast of North America; <i>Anguilla bostoniensis</i>,
in Eastern North America, China, and Japan; <i>Anguilla
lati</i><i>rostris</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span> in Temperate Europe, the whole Mediterranean
district, the West Indies, China, and New Zealand. The other more local
species are found, in addition to localities already mentioned, on the
East Coast of Africa, South Africa, on the continent of India, various
East Indian Islands, Australia, Tasmania, Auckland Islands; but none
have ever been found in South America, the West Coast of North America,
and the West Coast of Africa: surely one of the most striking instances
of irregular geographical distribution.</p>

<p>21. Numerous <i>Syngnathidæ</i> have established themselves in the
Northern Zone as well as in the Equatorial, in the vegetation which
flourishes in brackish water.</p>

<p>This list could be considerably increased if an enumeration of species,
especially of certain localities, were attempted; but this is more a
subject of local interest, and would carry us beyond the scope of a
general account of the distribution of Fishes.</p>

<h2 class="smaller">CHAPTER XIX.<br>
<span class="subhed">THE DISTRIBUTION OF MARINE FISHES.</span></h2></div>

<p>Marine fishes fall, with regard to their mode of life and distribution,
into three distinct categories:—</p>

<p>1. <i>Shore Fishes</i>—That is, fishes which inhabit chiefly parts
of the sea in the immediate neighbourhood of land either actually
raised above, or at least but little submerged below, the surface of
the water. They do not descend to any great depth,—very few to 300
fathoms, and the majority live close to the surface. The distribution
of these fishes is determined not only by the temperature of the
surface water but also by the nature of the adjacent land, and its
animal and vegetable products; some of these fishes being confined to
flat coasts with soft or sandy bottoms, others to rocky and fissured
coasts, others to living coral formations. If it were not for the
frequent mechanical and involuntary removals to which these fishes
are exposed, their distribution within certain limits, as it no doubt
originally existed, would resemble still more that of freshwater fishes
than we find it actually does at the present period.</p>

<p>2. <i>Pelagic Fishes</i>—that is, fishes which inhabit the surface
and uppermost strata of the open ocean, which approach the shores only
accidentally, or occasionally (in search of prey), or periodically
(for the purpose of spawning). The majority spawn in the open sea,
their ova and young being always found at great distance from the
shore. With regard to their distribution, they are still subject to
the influences of light and the temperature of the surface water; but
they are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span> independent of the variable local conditions which tie the
shore fish to its original home, and therefore roam freely over a space
which would take a freshwater or shore fish thousands of years to cover
in its gradual dispersal. Such as are devoid of rapidity of motion
are dispersed over similarly large areas by the oceanic currents,
more slowly than, but as surely as, the strong swimmers. Therefore,
an accurate definition of their distribution within certain areas
equivalent to the terrestrial regions is much less feasible than in the
case of shore fishes.</p>

<p>3. <i>Deep-sea Fishes</i>—that is, fishes which inhabit such depths
of the ocean as to be but little or not influenced by light or the
surface temperature; and which, by their organisation are prevented
from reaching the surface stratum in a healthy condition. Living almost
under identical tellurian conditions, the same type, the same species,
may inhabit an abyssal depth under the equator as well as one near the
arctic or antarctic circle; and all we know of these fishes points to
the conclusion that no separate horizontal regions can be distinguished
in the abyssal fauna, and that no division into bathymetrical strata
can be attempted on the base of generic much less of family characters.</p>

<p>It must not be imagined that these three categories are more sharply
defined than Freshwater and Marine Fishes. They gradually pass into
each other, and there are numerous fishes about which uncertainty
exists whether they should be placed in the Shore or Pelagic series, or
in the Pelagic or Deep-sea series; nay, many facts favour the view that
changes in the mode of life and distribution of fishes are still in
progress.</p>

<p>The change in habitat of numerous fishes is regulated by the
distribution of their favourite food. At certain seasons the surface
of the sea in the vicinity of land swarms with mollusks, larval
Crustaceans, Medusæ, attracting shoals of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span> fishes from the open ocean
to the shores; and these are again pursued by fishes of larger size and
predacious habits, so that all these fishes might be included, with
equal propriety, in the littoral or pelagic series. However, species
which are known to normally spawn in the open ocean must be always
referred to the latter division.</p>

<p>Chondropterygii, Acanthopterygii, Anacanths, Myxinoids, and
Pharyngobranchii furnish the principal contingents to the Marine Fauna;
whilst the majority of Malacopterygians, the Ganoids, and Cyclostomes
are Freshwater Fishes.</p>

<p>As with freshwater fishes, the main divisions of the Shore-fish faunæ
are determined by their distance from the equator, the equatorial
zone of the Freshwater series corresponding entirely to that of
the Shore-fish series. But as Marine fishes extend farther towards
the Poles than Freshwater fishes, and as the polar types are more
specialised, a distinct Arctic and Antarctic fauna may be separated
from the faunæ of the temperate zones. The two subdivisions of the
Northern temperate zone in the Freshwater series are quite analogous
to the corresponding divisions in the Coast series. In the Southern
Hemisphere the Shore-fishes of the extremity of Africa form a separate
district of the temperate zone, whilst the Freshwater fishes of
South Africa were found to be tropical types. The Marine series of
the Southern temperate zone is also much more diversified than the
Freshwater series, and admits of further subdivision, which, although
in some degree indicated in the Freshwater series, does not entirely
correspond to that proposed for the latter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span></p>


<h3>I. <span class="smcap">Shore Fishes of the Arctic Ocean.</span></h3>

<p>The Shore fishes clearly prove a continuity of the Arctic circumpolar
fauna, as the southern limit of which we may indicate the southern
extremity of Greenland and the Aleutian Archipelago, or 60° of lat. N.</p>

<p>Towards the North, fishes become less in variety of species and fewer
in number of individuals, and only very few genera are restricted to
this fauna.</p>

<p>The highest latitude at which Shore fishes have been observed is 83°
N. lat. The late Arctic Expedition collected at and near that latitude
specimens of <i>Cottus quadricornis</i>, <i>Icelus hamatus</i>,
<i>Cyclopterus spinosus</i>, <i>Liparis fabricii</i>, <i>Gymnelis
viridis</i>, and <i>Gadus fabricii</i>. This number probably would have
been larger if the difficulties of collecting fishes in those high
latitudes were not almost insuperable for the greater part of the year.</p>

<p>As far as we know, the fishes north and south of Behring’s Straits
belong to the same generic or family types as those of the
corresponding latitudes of the Eastern Hemisphere, though the majority
are specifically distinct. But the information we possess of the fishes
of the northernmost extremity of the Pacific is extremely scanty and
vague. Farther south, whence now and then a collection reaches Europe,
we meet with some European species, as the Herring, Halibut, Hake.</p>

<p>The Chondropterygians are very scarce, and it is doubtful whether
another Chondropterygian, beside the pelagic <i>Læmargus</i> or
Greenland Shark, crosses the Arctic circle. In the more temperate
latitudes of South Greenland, Iceland, and Northern Scandinavia,
<i>Acanthias</i>, <i>Centroscyllium</i>, and a species of <i>Raja</i>,
also <i>Chimæra</i>, are met with.</p>

<p>Of Acanthopterygians the families of <i>Cottidæ</i>,
<i>Cataphracti</i>, <i>Discoboli</i>, and <i>Blenniidæ</i> are
well represented, and several of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span> genera are characteristic
of the Arctic fauna: marine species of <i>Cottus</i>;
<i>Centridermichthys</i>, <i>Icelus</i>, <i>Triglops</i>;
<i>Agonus</i>, <i>Aspidophoroides</i>; <i>Anarrhichas</i>,
<i>Centronotus</i>, <i>Stichæus</i>; <i>Cyclopterus</i> and
<i>Liparis</i>. Two species of <i>Sebastes</i> are rather common.</p>

<p>Characteristic is also the development of Gadoid fishes, of which
some thirteen species, belonging to <i>Gadus</i>, <i>Merluccius</i>,
and <i>Molva</i>, form one of the principal articles of food to
the inhabitants of the coasts of the Arctic Ocean. The Blennioid
Anacanthini or <i>Lycodidæ</i>, are limited to the Arctic and Antarctic
coasts. <i>Ammodytes</i> and a few Flat-fishes (<i>Hippoglossoides</i>
and <i>Pleuronectes</i>) are common in the more temperate parts.</p>

<p>Labroids only exceptionally penetrate so far towards the north.</p>

<p>Physostomes are very scarce, and represented only by a few species
of <i>Clupea</i> and by <i>Mallotus</i>; the latter is an ancient
inhabitant of the Greenland coasts, fossil remains, indistinguishable
from the species of the present day, being frequently found in nodules
of clay of comparatively recent formation.</p>

<p>The Arctic climate is still less favourable to the existence of
Lophobranchs, only a few <i>Syngnathus</i> and <i>Nerophis</i> being
present in the more southern latitudes, to which they have been carried
by oceanic currents from their more congenial home in the south.
Scleroderms and Plectognaths are entirely absent.</p>

<p>The Gadoids are accompanied by <i>Myxine</i>, which parasitically
thrives in them.</p>


<h3>II. <span class="smcap">The Northern Temperate Zone.</span></h3>


<h4>A. <i>Shore Fishes of the Temperate North Atlantic</i>.</h4>

<p>This part of the fauna may be subdivided into three districts:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span></p>

<p>1. The fishes of the north-eastern shores, viz. of the British
islands, of Scandinavia so far as it is not included in the Arctic
fauna, and of the continent of Europe southwards to about 40° of lat.
N.—<i>British</i> district.</p>

<p>2. The fishes of the Mediterranean shores and of the adjoining shores
of the Atlantic, including the Azores, Madeira, and the Canary
Islands—<i>Mediterranean</i> district.</p>

<p>3. The fishes of the western shores, from 60° lat. N. to about 30° lat.
N.—the <i>North American</i> district.</p>

<p class="p1">1. The <i>British</i> district shows scarcely any marked distinctive
features; the character of its fauna is simply intermediate between
that of the Arctic Ocean and the Mediterranean district; truly Arctic
forms disappear, while such as are also found in the Mediterranean make
their appearance. Also with regard to the abundance of individuals
and variety of fishes this district forms a transition from the north
towards the south.</p>

<p>Besides the few Arctic Chondropterygians, all of which extend into
this district, the small shore Dog-fishes are well represented
(<i>Mustelus</i>, <i>Galeus</i>, <i>Scyllium</i>, <i>Pristiurus</i>);
the ubiquitous Rhina or Monk-fish is common; of Rays, <i>Raja</i>
predominates in a variety of species over <i>Torpedo</i> and
<i>Trygon</i>, which are still scarce.</p>

<p>Of Acanthopterygians, <i>Centridermichthys</i>, <i>Icelus</i>,
<i>Triglops</i>, and <i>Aspidophoroides</i>, do not extend from the
north into this district; and <i>Cottus</i>, <i>Anarrhichas</i>,
<i>Centronotus</i>, <i>Stichæus</i>, the <i>Discoboli</i> disappear
within its limits. Nearly all the remainder are genera which are
also found in the Mediterranean districts. The following are
the principal forms, and known to propagate on these shores:
<i>Labrax</i>; <i>Serranus</i>, <i>Polyprion</i>, <i>Dentex</i>;
<i>Mullus</i>; <i>Cantharus</i>, <i>Pagrus</i>, <i>Pagellus</i>;
<i>Sebastes</i>; <i>Cottus</i>, <i>Trigla</i>, <i>Agonus</i>;
<i>Trachinus</i>; <i>Sciæna</i> (?); <i>Zeus</i>; <i>Trachurus</i>,
<i>Capros</i>; <i>Callionymus</i>; <i>Discoboli</i>; <i>Lophius</i>;
<i>Anarrhichas</i>, <i>Centronotus</i>, <i>Stich</i><i>æus</i>;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
<i>Blenniops</i>, <i>Zoarces</i> (not in Mediterranean); <i>Cepola</i>;
<i>Lepadogaster</i>.</p>

<p>Of the Anacanthini the Gadoids are as numerous as in the Arctic
Ocean, most being common to both districts; they are represented by
<i>Gadus</i>, <i>Gadiculus</i>, <i>Merluccius</i>, <i>Phycis</i>,
<i>Molva</i>, <i>Motella</i>, <i>Raniceps</i>, and <i>Brosmius</i>;
but, whilst the majority show their northern origin by not extending
into the Mediterranean, <i>Ammodytes</i> and most <i>Pleuronectidæ</i>
prove themselves to be the more southern representatives of this
order. In the British district we find <i>Hippoglossus</i>,
<i>Hippoglossoides</i>, <i>Rhombus</i>, <i>Phrynorhombus</i>,
<i>Pleuronectes</i>, <i>Solea</i>, and only the two first are not met
with in the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>Labroids are common; with the exception of the North American
<i>Tautoga</i>, all the other genera are met with.</p>

<p>Physostomes are not well represented, viz. by one species of
<i>Osmerus</i>, one of <i>Engraulis</i>, one of <i>Conger</i>, and
about five of <i>Clupea</i>.</p>

<p><i>Syngnathus</i> and <i>Nerophis</i> become more common as we proceed
southwards; but the existence of Scleroderms and Plectognaths is
indicated by single individuals only, stragglers from their southern
home, and unable to establish themselves in a climate ungenial to them.</p>

<p>The Gadoids are accompanied by <i>Myxine</i>; and <i>Branchiostoma</i>
may be found in all suitable localities.</p>

<p class="p1">2. The <i>Mediterranean</i> district is distinguished by a great
variety of forms; yet, with the exception of a few genera established
for single species, none of the forms can be considered peculiar to
it; and even that small number of peculiar genera is more and more
diminished as our knowledge of the distribution of fishes advances.
Some genera are identical with those found on the western coasts of the
Atlantic and in the West Indies; but a most remarkable and unexpected
affinity obtains with another very distant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span> fauna, viz. that of
Japan. The number of genera common to the Mediterranean district and
the Japanese coasts is larger than that of the genera common to the
Mediterranean and the opposite American coasts.</p>

<p>The Chondropterygians found in the British district continue in the
Mediterranean, their number being increased by <i>Centrina</i>,
<i>Spinax</i>, <i>Pteroplatea</i>, and some species of
<i>Rhinobatus</i>, a genus more numerously represented in the Tropics.
<i>Torpedo</i> and <i>Trygon</i> are common.</p>

<p>The greatest variety belong to the Acanthopterygians, as will be
seen from the following list:—<i>Labrax</i>; <i>Anthias</i>,
<i>Serranus</i>, <i>Polyprion</i>, <i>Apogon</i>, <i>Pomatomus</i>,
<i>Pristipoma</i>, <i>Diagramma</i> (an Indian genus with two
Mediterranean species, and otherwise not represented in the
Atlantic), <i>Dentex</i>, <i>Mæna</i>, <i>Smaris</i>; <i>Mullus</i>;
<i>Cantharus</i>, <i>Box</i>, <i>Scatharxs</i>, <i>Oblata</i>,
<i>Sargus</i>, <i>Pagrus</i>, <i>Pagellus</i>, <i>Chrysophrys</i>;
<i>Sebastes</i>, <i>Scorpæna</i>; <i>Hoplostethus</i>, <i>Beryx</i>,
<i>Polymixia</i>; <i>Trigla</i>, <i>Lepidotrigla</i>, <i>Agonus</i>,
<i>Peristethus</i>; <i>Trachinus</i>, <i>Uranoscopus</i>;
<i>Umbrina</i>, <i>Sciæna</i>; <i>Sphyræna</i>; <i>Aphanopus</i>,
<i>Lepidopus</i>, <i>Nesiarchus</i>, <i>Trichiurus</i>,
<i>Thyrsites</i>; <i>Cubiceps</i>; <i>Zeus</i>, <i>Cyttus</i>;
<i>Stromateus</i>; <i>Trachurus</i>, <i>Caranx</i>, <i>Capros</i>,
<i>Diretmus</i>, <i>Antigonia</i>; <i>Callionymus</i>;
<i>Batrachus</i>; <i>Lophius</i>; <i>Cristiceps</i>,
<i>Tripterygium</i>; <i>Cepola</i>; <i>Lepadogaster</i>;
<i>Centriscus</i>; <i>Notacanthus</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Labridæ</i> are as common as, or even more so than, in the
British district, and represented by the same genera. But, besides,
some other Pharyngognaths, properly belonging to the Tropical Atlantic,
have fully established themselves, though only by a few species,
viz. <i>Glyphidodon</i> and <i>Heliastes</i>; <i>Cossyphus</i>,
<i>Novacula</i>, <i>Julis</i>, <i>Coris</i>, and <i>Scarus</i>.</p>

<p>The Gadoids show a marked decrease of development; and the species
of <i>Gadus</i>, <i>Gadiculus</i>, <i>Mora</i>, <i>Strinsia</i>,
<i>Phycis</i>, and <i>Molva</i>, which are peculiar to the
Mediterranean, seem to inhabit rather the colder water of moderate
depths, than the surface near the shore. <i>Motella</i>, however,
proves to be a true<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span> Shore fish also in the Mediterranean, at least
in its adult state. <i>Ophidium</i> and <i>Fierasfer</i> appear
now besides <i>Ammodytes</i>. As the Gadoids decrease, so the
<i>Pleuronectidæ</i> increase, the genera of the Mediterranean district
being <i>Rhombus</i>, <i>Phrynorhombus</i>, <i>Arnoglossus</i>,
<i>Citharus</i>, <i>Rhomboidichthys</i>, <i>Pleuronectes</i> (a
northern genus not extending farther southwards), <i>Solea</i>,
<i>Synaptura</i>, and <i>Ammopleurops</i>.</p>

<p>The variety of Physostomes is small; the following only being
superadded to those of the British district:—<i>Saurus</i> (a tropical
genus), <i>Aulopus</i>; <i>Congromuræna</i>, <i>Heteroconger</i>,
<i>Myrus</i>, <i>Ophichthys</i>, <i>Muræna</i>.</p>

<p>The Lophobranchs are more numerous in species and individuals
than in the British district; and, besides <i>Syngnathus</i> and
<i>Nerophis</i>, several species of <i>Hippocampus</i> are common. Also
a few species of <i>Balistes</i> occur.</p>

<p><i>Myxine</i> is lost in this district; whilst <i>Branchiostoma</i> is
abundant.</p>

<p class="p1">3. The shore fishes of the <i>North American</i> district consist, as
on the eastern coasts of the North Atlantic, of northern and southern
elements; but they are still more mixed with each other than on the
European coasts, so that a boundary line cannot be drawn between
them. The affinity to the fauna of the eastern shores is great, but
almost entirely limited to the genera composing the fauna of the
British district. British genera not found on the American coasts
are—<i>Galeus</i>, <i>Scyllium</i>, <i>Chimæra</i>, <i>Mullus</i>,
<i>Pagellus</i>, <i>Trigla</i>, <i>Trachinus</i>, <i>Zeus</i>,
<i>Callionymus</i>. The southern elements of North America are
rather derived from the West Indies, and have no special affinity to
Mediterranean forms; very few of the non-British Mediterranean forms
extend across the Atlantic; instead of a Mediterranean we find a West
Indian element. Many of the British <i>species</i> range across the
Atlantic, and inhabit in an unchanged condition the northern parts of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
this district; and from the frequent occurrence of isolated specimens
of other British species on the North American coast, we may presume
that many more occasionally cross the Atlantic, but without being able
to obtain a permanent footing.</p>

<p>The genera peculiar to this district are few in number, and composed
of very few species, viz. <i>Hemitripterus</i>, <i>Pammelas</i>,
<i>Chasmodes</i>, <i>Cryptacanthodes</i>, and <i>Tautoga</i>.</p>

<p>The close resemblance of what must be considered northern forms to
those of Europe will be evident from the following list:—</p>

<p><i>Mustelus, Rhina, Torpedo, Raja, Trygon.</i></p>

<p><i>Labrax, Centropristis, Serranus; Pagrus, Chrysophrys; Sebastes,
Hemitripterus; Cottus, Aspidophoroides; Uranoscopus; Micropogon,
Pogonias, Sciæna; Trachurus, Pammelas; Cyclopterus, Liparis; Lophius;
Anarrhichas, Chasmodes, Stichcæus, Centronotus, Cryptacanthodes,
Zoarces.</i></p>

<p><i>Tautoga, Ctenolabrus.</i></p>

<p><i>Gadus, Merluccius, Phycis, Molva, Motella, Brosmius; Ophidium</i>
(one species, perhaps identical with a Mediterranean species);
<i>Ammodytes; Hippoglossus, Hippoglossoides, Rhombus, Pleuronectes</i>.</p>

<p><i>Osmerus, Mallotus; Engraulis, Clupea; Conger.</i></p>

<p><i>Syngnathus—Myxine—Branchiostoma.</i></p>

<p>West Indian genera, or at least genera which are more developed within
the tropics, and which extend more or less northwards in the North
American district, are:—</p>

<p><i>Pteroplatea</i> (also in the Mediterranean).</p>

<p><i>Gerres, Dules (auriga), Lobotes, Ephippus; Sargus; Prionotus;
Umbrina, Otolithus, Larimus; Sphyræna</i> (Mediterr.);
<i>Trichiurus</i> (Mediterr.); <i>Elacate; Cybium, Trachynotus;
Stromateus</i> (Mediterr.); <i>Caranx</i>; <i>Batrachus</i>
(Mediterr.); <i>Malthe</i>.</p>

<p><i>Pseudorhombus</i>, <i>Solea</i> (Mediterr.)</p>

<p><i>Saurus</i> (Mediterr.); <i>Etrumeus, Albula, Elops, Megalops</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span></p>

<p><i>Hippocampus</i> (Mediterr.)</p>

<p><i>Balistes, Monacanthus.</i></p>


<h4>B. <span class="smcap">Shore Fishes of the Temperate North Pacific.</span></h4>

<p>This fauna shows a great affinity to that of the temperate North
Atlantic, not only in including a considerable proportion of identical
genera, and even of species, but also in having its constituent parts
similarly distributed. However, our knowledge of the ichthyology of
this fauna is by no means complete. Very few collections have been
made in Northern Japan, and on the coasts farther north of it; and,
again, the ichthyology of the coasts of Southern California is but
little known. Southern Japan has been well searched, but very little
attention has been paid to the extent of the northward range of the
species. In collections made by Mr. Swinhoe at Chefoo, in lat. 37° N.,
the proportions of temperate and tropical fishes were found to be about
equal. Thus, the details of the distribution of the fishes of these
shores have still to be worked out; nevertheless, three divisions may
be recognised which, for the present, may be defined as follows:—</p>

<p>1. The fishes of the north-western shores, to about 37°
lat. N., including the corresponding northern parts of
Japan—<i>Kamtschatkan</i> district; this corresponds to the British
district of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>2. The fishes of Southern Japan and the corresponding shores of the
continent of Asia, between 37° and 30° lat. N.—<i>Japanese</i>
district, which corresponds to the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>3. The fishes of the eastern shores southwards to the latitude of San
Francisco—<i>Californian</i> district; this corresponds to the North
American district of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>Too little is known of the shore fishes of the coasts between San
Francisco and the tropic to enable us to treat of it as a separate
division.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span></p>

<p>The Shore fishes of the North Pacific generally are composed of the
following elements:—</p>

<p><i>a.</i> Arctic forms which extend into the Arctic Ocean, and the
majority of which are also found in the British district.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> Peculiar forms limited to the North Pacific, like the
<i>Heterolepidina</i>, <i>Embiotocidæ</i>, and certain Cottoid and
Blennioid genera.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> Forms identical with fishes of the Mediterranean.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> Peculiar forms limited to the southern parts of Japan.</p>

<p><i>e.</i> Tropical forms which have entered the North Pacific from the
south.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>1. The small list of fishes which we can assign to the
<i>Kamtschatkan</i> district is due rather to the imperfect manner
in which its fauna has been explored than to its actual poverty of
fishes; thus, although we may be sure that sooner or later the small
kinds of Dog-fishes of the British district will be found there also,
at present we have positive knowledge of the occurrence of only two
Chondropterygians, viz. <i>Chimæra</i> and <i>Raja</i>. The species of
the latter genus seem to be much less numerous than in the Atlantic.</p>

<p>Of Acanthopterygians the following are known:—<i>Sebastes</i>;
<i>Chirus</i>, <i>Agrammus</i>; <i>Podabrus</i>, <i>Blepsias</i>,
<i>Cottus</i>, <i>Centridermichthys</i>, <i>Hemilepidotus</i>,
<i>Agonus</i>; <i>Trichodon</i>; <i>Callionymus</i>; <i>Liparis</i>;
<i>Dictyosoma</i>, <i>Stichæus</i>, <i>Centronotus</i>.</p>

<p>Labroids are absent; they are clearly a type unable to endure great
cold; of the Embiotocoids which represent them in the Pacific, one
species only (a species of <i>Ditrema</i>) is known from this district.</p>

<p>The Gadoids are, so far as we know at present, sparsely represented,
viz. by isolated species of <i>Gadus</i>, <i>Motella</i>, and
<i>Lotella</i>, the latter being an inhabitant of moderate depths
rather than of the surface. <i>Hippoglossus</i>, <i>Pleuronectes</i>,
and <i>Parophrys</i>, seem to occur everywhere at suitable localities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span></p>

<p>The Physostomes are nearly the same as in the British district, viz.
a Smelt (<i>Hypomesus</i>), probably also the Arctic <i>Mallotus</i>,
an Anchovy, several species of <i>Clupea</i>, and the Conger-eel. A
very singular Salmonoid fish, <i>Salanx</i>, which is limited to the
north-western Pacific, occurs in great abundance.</p>

<p>Also, the Lophobranchs correspond in their development to those of the
British district, <i>Nerophis</i> being replaced by <i>Urocampus</i>.</p>

<p>Neither Myxinoids nor <i>Branchiostoma</i> have as yet been found.</p>

<p class="p1">2. The <i>Japanese</i> district is, like the Mediterranean,
distinguished by a great variety of forms; some of them are peculiar
to it (marked <i>J.</i> in the following list); others occur in
the Mediterranean, though also in other districts (<i>M.</i>) The
resemblance to the Mediterranean is even greater than would appear from
the following list of genera, inasmuch as a considerable number of
species are identical in both districts. Three of the Berycoid genera
have hitherto been found in the Japanese and Mediterranean districts
only, and nowhere else. Another very singular fact is that some of
the most characteristic genera, like <i>Mullus</i>, <i>Zeus</i>,
<i>Callionymus</i>, <i>Centriscus</i>, inhabit the Mediterranean
and Japanese districts, <i>but have never reached the opposite
American coasts, either in the Atlantic or Pacific</i>; although,
at least in the latter, the oceanic currents would rather favour
than obstruct their dispersal in the direction towards America. Bold
as the hypothesis may appear, we can only account for the singular
distribution of these shore fishes by assuming that the Mediterranean
and Japanese seas were in direct and open communication with each other
within the period of the existence of the present Teleosteous Fauna.</p>

<p>Gadoids have disappeared, or are represented by forms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span> inhabiting
moderate depths. Neither Myxine nor <i>Branchiostoma</i> are known to
have as yet been found.</p>

<p>3. The <i>Californian</i> district includes a marked northern element,
the principal constituents of which are identical with types occurring
in the corresponding district of the Atlantic, viz. the North
American, as exemplified by <i>Discoboli</i>, <i>Anarrhichas</i>,
<i>Centronotus</i>, <i>Cottus</i>, <i>Hippoglossus</i>, <i>Clupea</i>
(<i>harengus</i>), etc. But it possesses also, in the greatest
degree of development, some types almost peculiar to itself, as the
<i>Heterolepidina</i>, some remarkable Cottoid and Blennioid genera,
and more especially the Embiotocoids—viviparous Pharyngognaths—which
replace the Labroids of the other hemisphere. Gadoids are much less
numerous than in the North American district. The southern forms are
but little known, but it may be anticipated that, owing to the partial
identity of the Faunæ of the two coasts of the Isthmus of Panama, a
fair proportion of West Indian forms will be found to have entered this
district from the south. The following are the principal genera:—</p>

<p><i>Chimœra</i>, <i>Galeus</i>, <i>Mustelus</i>, <i>Triacis</i>,
<i>Cestracion</i>, <i>Rhina</i>, <i>Raja</i>.</p>

<h3>III.—<span class="smcap">The Equatorial Zone.</span></h3>

<p>As we approach the Tropic from the north, the tribes characteristic
of the Arctic and Temperate zones become scarcer, and disappear
altogether: to be replaced by the greater variety of Tropical types.
Of Chondropterygians, the <i>Chimœridœ</i>, <i>Spinacidœ</i>,
<i>Mustelus</i>, and <i>Raja</i>, do not pass the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span> Tropic, or appear
in single species only; and of Teleosteans, the <i>Berycidæ</i>,
<i>Pagrus</i>, the <i>Heterolepidina</i>, <i>Cottus</i> and allied
genera, <i>Lophius</i>, <i>Anarrhichas</i>, <i>Stichæus</i>,
<i>Lepadogaster</i>, <i>Psychrolutes</i>, <i>Centriscus</i>,
<i>Notacanthus</i>, the <i>Labridæ</i> and <i>Embiotocidæ</i>, the
<i>Lycodidæ</i>, <i>Gadidæ</i>, and marine <i>Salmonidæ</i> disappear
either entirely, or retire from the shores and surface into the depths
of the ocean.</p>

<p>With regard to variety of forms, as well as to number of individuals,
this zone far surpasses either of the temperate zones; in this
respect, the life in the sea is as that on the land. Coast fishes
are not confined to the actual coast-line, but abound on the coral
reefs, with which some parts of the Atlantic and Pacific are studded,
and many of which are submerged below the water. The abundance of
animal and vegetable life which flourishes on them renders them the
favourite pasture-grounds for the endless variety of coral-fishes
(<i>Squamipinnes</i>, <i>Acronuridæ</i>, <i>Pomacentridæ</i>,
<i>Julidæ</i>, <i>Plectognathi</i>, etc.), and for the larger predatory
kinds. The colours and grotesque forms of the Fishes of the Tropics
have justly excited the admiration of the earliest observers. Scarlet,
black, blue, pink, red, yellow, etc., are arranged in patterns of the
most bizarre fashion, mingling in spots, lines, bands; and reminding
us of the words of Captain Cook when describing the coral-reefs of
Palmerston Island: “The glowing appearance of the Mollusks was still
inferior to that of the multitude of fishes that glided gently along,
seemingly with the most perfect security. The colours of the different
sorts were the most beautiful that can be imagined—the yellow, blue,
red, black, etc., far exceeding anything that art can produce. Their
various forms, also, contributed to increase the richness of this
sub-marine grotto, which could not be surveyed without a pleasing
transport.”</p>

<p>Of Chondropterygians the <i>Scylliidæ</i>, <i>Pristis</i>
(Saw-fishes), <i>Rhinobatidæ</i>, and <i>Trygonidæ</i> attain to the
greatest development.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span> Of Acanthopterygians <i>Centropristis</i>,
<i>Serranus</i>, <i>Plectropoma</i>, <i>Mesoprion</i>,

<i>Cirrhites</i>, some genera of <i>Scorpænidæ</i>,
<i>Platycephalus</i>, <i>Sciænidæ</i>, <i>Sphyræna</i>, <i>Caranx</i>
<i>Equula</i>, <i>Callionymus</i>, <i>Teuthis</i>, <i>Acanthurus</i>,
<i>Naseus</i>, are represented by numerous species; and the majority of
these genera and families are limited to this zone. Of Pharyngognaths
the <i>Pomacentridæ</i>, <i>Julidina</i>, and <i>Scarina</i>, are met
with near every coral formation in a living condition. Of Gadoids,
a singular minute form, <i>Bregmaceros</i>, is almost the only
representative, the other forms belonging to deep water, and rarely
ascending to the surface. Flat-fishes (<i>Pleuronectidæ</i>) are common
on sandy coasts, and the majority of the genera are peculiar to the
Tropics. Of <i>Physostomi</i> only the <i>Saurina</i>, <i>Clupeidæ</i>,
and <i>Murænidæ</i> are represented, the <i>Clupeidæ</i> being
exceedingly numerous in individuals, whilst the <i>Murænidæ</i>
live more isolated, but show a still greater variety of species.
Lophobranchii and Sclerodermi are generally distributed. Branchiostoma
has been found on several coasts.</p>

<p>Geographically it is convenient to describe the Coast fauna of the
tropical Atlantic separately from that of the Indo-Pacific ocean. The
differences between them, however, are far less numerous and important
than between the freshwater or terrestrial faunæ of continental
regions. The majority of the principal types are found in both, many of
the species being even identical; but the species are far more abundant
in the Indo-Pacific than in the Atlantic, owing to the greater extent
of the archipelagoes in the former. But for the broken and varied
character of the coasts of the West Indies, the shores of the tropical
Atlantic would, by their general uniformity, afford but a limited
variety of conditions to the development of specific and generic
forms, whilst the deep inlets of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span> Indian ocean, with the varying
configuration of their coasts, and the different nature of their
bottom, its long peninsulas, and its archipelagoes, and the scattered
islands of the tropical Pacific, render this part of the globe the
most perfect for the development of fish-life. The fishes of the
Indian and Pacific oceans (between the Tropics) are almost identical,
and the number of species ranging from the Red Sea and east coast of
Africa to Polynesia, even to its westernmost islands, is very great
indeed. However, this Indo-Pacific fauna does not reach the Pacific
coast of South America. The wide space devoid of islands, east of the
Sandwich Islands and the Marquesas group, together with the current
of cold water which sweeps northwards along the South American coast,
has proved to be a very effectual barrier to the eastward extension
of the Indo-Pacific fauna of coast fishes; and, consequently, we find
an assemblage of fishes on the American coast and at the Galapagoes
Islands, sufficiently distinct to constitute a distinct zoological
division.</p>

<p>The following list, which contains only the principal genera and groups
of coast fishes, will give an idea of the affinity of the tropical
Atlantic and Indo-Pacific:—<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<h4>A. <i>Shore Fishes of the Tropical Atlantic.</i></h4>

<p>The boundaries of the tropical Atlantic extend zoologically a few
degrees beyond the Northern and Southern Tropics, but as the mixture
with the types of the temperate zone is very gradual, no distinct
boundary line can be drawn between the tropical and temperate faunæ.</p>

<p>Types, almost exclusively limited to it, and not found in the
Indo-Pacific, are few in number, as <i>Centropristis</i>,
<i>Rhypticus</i>, <i>Hæmulon</i>, <i>Malthe</i>. A few
others preponderate with regard to the number of species,
as <i>Plectropoma</i>, <i>Sargus</i>, <i>Trachynotus</i>,
<i>Batrachidæ</i>, and <i>Gobiesocidæ</i>. The Sciænoids are equally
represented in both oceans. All the remainder are found in both; but in
the minority in the Atlantic, where they are sometimes represented by
one or two species only (for instance, <i>Lethrinus</i>).</p>


<h4>B. <i>Shore Fishes of the Tropical Indo-Pacific Ocean.</i></h4>

<p>The ichthyological boundaries of this part of the tropical zone may be
approximately given as 30° of lat. N. and S.; on the Australian coasts
it should probably be placed still farther south, viz., to 34°; it
includes, as mentioned above, the Sandwich Islands, and all the islands
of the South Sea, but not the American coasts.</p>

<p>Some eighty genera of Shore fishes are peculiar to the Indo-Pacific,
but the majority consists of one or a few species<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span> only; comparatively
few have a plurality of species, as <i>Diagramma</i>, <i>Lethrinus</i>,
<i>Equula</i>, <i>Teuthis</i>, <i>Amphiprion</i>, <i>Dascyllus</i>,
<i>Choerops</i>, <i>Chilinus</i>, <i>Anampses</i>, <i>Stethojulis</i>,
<i>Coris</i>, <i>Coilia</i>.</p>

<p>The Sea-perches, large and small, which feed on Crustaceans and
other small fishes, and the coral-feeding Pharyngognaths are the
types which show the greatest generic and specific variety in the
Indo-Pacific. Then follow the <i>Squamipinnes</i> and <i>Murænidæ</i>,
the <i>Clupeidæ</i> and <i>Carangidæ</i> families in which the
variety is more that of species than of genus. The <i>Scorpænidæ</i>,
<i>Pleuronectidæ</i>, <i>Acronuridæ</i>, <i>Sciænidæ</i>,
<i>Syngnathidæ</i>, and <i>Teuthyes</i>, are those which contribute
the next largest contingents. Of shore-loving Chondropterygians the
<i>Scylliidæ</i> and <i>Trygonidæ</i> only are represented in moderate
numbers, though they are more numerous in this ocean than in any other.</p>


<h4>C. <i>Shore Fishes of the Pacific Coasts of Tropical America</i>.</h4>

<p>As boundaries within which this fauna is comprised, may be indicated
30° lat. N. and S., as in the Indo-Pacific. Its distinction from the
Indo-Pacific lies in the almost entire absence of coral-feeding fishes.
There are scarcely any Squamipinnes, Pharyngognaths or Acronuridæ, and
the Teuthyes are entirely absent. The genera that remain are such as
are found in the tropical zone generally, but the species are entirely
different from those of the Indo-Pacific. They are mixed with a
sprinkling of peculiar genera, consisting of one or two species, like
<i>Discopyge</i>, <i>Hoplopagrus</i>, <i>Doydixodon</i>, but they are
too few in number to give a strikingly peculiar character to this fauna.</p>

<p>The Three districts are distinguishable:—</p>

<p>a. <i>Central American district</i>, in which we include, for the
present, Lower California, shows so near an affinity to the tropical
Atlantic that, if it were not separated from it by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span> neck of land
uniting the two American Continents, it would most assuredly be
regarded as a portion of the Fauna of the tropical Atlantic. With
scarcely any exceptions the genera are identical, and of the species
found on the Pacific side nearly one-half have proved to be the same
as those of the Atlantic. The explanation of this fact has been found
in the existence of communications between the two oceans by channels
and straits which must have been open till within a recent period.
The isthmus of Central America was then partially submerged, and
appeared as a chain of islands similar to that of the Antilles; but as
the reef-building corals flourished chiefly north and east of those
islands, and were absent south and west of them, reef-fishes were
excluded from the Pacific shores when the communications were destroyed
by the upheaval of the land.</p>

<p><i>b</i>. The <i>Galapagoes district</i> received its coast fauna
principally from the Central American district, a part of the
species being absolutely the same as on the coast of the Isthmus
of Panama, or as in the West Indies. Yet the isolation of this
group has continued a sufficiently long period to allow of the
development of a number of distinct species of either peculiarly
Atlantic genera (such as <i>Centropristis</i>, <i>Rhypticus</i>,
<i>Gobiesox</i>, <i>Prionotus</i>), or at least tropical genera
(such as <i>Chrysophrys</i>, <i>Pristipoma</i>, <i>Holacanthus</i>,
<i>Caranx</i>, <i>Balistes</i>). A few other types from the Peruvian
coast (<i>Doydixodon</i>), or even from Japan (<i>Prionurus</i>),
have established themselves in this group of islands. A species of
<i>Cestracion</i> has also reached the Galapagoes, but whether from the
south, north, or west, cannot be determined.</p>

<p>The presence of the Atlantic fauna on the Pacific side is felt still
farther west than the Galapagoes, some Atlantic species having reached
the Sandwich Islands, as <i>Chætodon humeralis</i> and <i>Blennius
brevipinnis</i>.</p>

<p>c. The <i>Peruvian district</i> possesses a very limited variety<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span> of
shore fishes, which belong, with few exceptions, like <i>Discopyge</i>,
<i>Hoplognathus</i>, <i>Doydixodon</i>, to genera distributed
throughout the tropical zone, or even beyond it. But the species,
so far as they are known at present, are distinct from those of the
Indo-Pacific, as well as of the tropical Atlantic; and therefore
this district cannot be joined either to the Central American or the
Galapagoes.</p>


<h3>IV.—<span class="smcap">The Southern Temperate Zone</span>.</h3>

<p>This zone includes the coasts of the southern extremity of Africa, from
about 30° lat. S., of the south of Australia with Tasmania, of New
Zealand, and the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of South America between
30° and 50° lat. S.</p>

<p>The most striking character of this fauna is the reappearance of types
inhabiting the corresponding latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere,
and not found in the intervening tropical zone. This interruption of
the continuity in the geographical distribution of Shore-fishes is
exemplified by species as well as genera, for instance—<i>Chimæra
monstrosa</i>, <i>Galeus canis</i>, <i>Acanthias vulgaris</i>,
<i>Acanthias blainvillii</i>, <i>Rhina squatina</i>, <i>Zeus faber</i>,
<i>Lophius piscatorius</i>, <i>Centriscus scolopax</i>, <i>Engraulis
encrasicholus</i>, <i>Clupea sprattus</i>, <i>Conger vulgaris</i>.
Instances of genera are still more numerous—<i>Cestracion</i>,
<i>Spinax</i>, <i>Pristiophorus</i>, <i>Raja</i>; <i>Callanthias</i>,
<i>Polyprion</i>, <i>Histiopterus</i>, <i>Cantharus</i>, <i>Box</i>,
<i>Girella</i>, <i>Pagellus</i>, <i>Chilodactylus</i>, <i>Sebastes</i>,
<i>Aploactis</i>, <i>Agonus</i>, <i>Lepidopus</i>, <i>Cyttus</i>,
<i>Psychrolutidæ</i>, <i>Notacanthus</i>; <i>Lycodes</i>,
<i>Merluccius</i>, <i>Lotella</i>, <i>Phycis</i>, <i>Motella</i>;
<i>Aulopus</i>; <i>Urocampus</i>, <i>Solenognathus</i>; <i>Myxine</i>.</p>

<p>Naturally, where the coasts of the tropical zone are continuous
with those of the temperate, a number of tropical genera enter the
latter, and genera which we have found between the tropics as well
as in the temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere, extend in a
similar manner towards the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span> south. But the truly tropical forms are
absent; there are no <i>Squamipinnes</i>, scarcely any <i>Mullidæ</i>,
no <i>Acronuri</i>, no <i>Teuthyes</i>, no <i>Pomacentridæ</i>
(with a single exception on the coast of Chili), only one genus of
<i>Julidina</i>, no <i>Scarina</i>, which are replaced by another
group of Pharyngognaths, the <i>Odacina</i>. The <i>Labrina</i>, so
characteristic of the temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere,
reappear in a distinct genus (<i>Malacopterus</i>) on the coast of Juan
Fernandez.</p>

<p>The family of <i>Berycidæ</i>, equally interesting with regard to their
distribution in time and in space, consists of temperate and tropical
genera. The genus by which this family is represented in the southern
temperate zone (<i>Trachichthys</i>) is much more nearly allied to the
northern than to the tropical genera.</p>

<p>The true <i>Cottina</i> and <i>Heterolepidina</i> (forms with a bony
stay of the præoperculum, which is generally armed) have not crossed
the tropical zone; they are replaced by fishes extremely similar in
general form, and having the same habits, but lacking that osteological
peculiarity. Their southern analogues belong chiefly to the family
<i>Trachinidæ</i>, and are types of genera peculiar to the Southern
Hemisphere.</p>

<p>The <i>Discoboli</i> of the Northern Hemisphere have likewise
not penetrated to the south, where they are represented by
<i>Gobiesocidæ</i>. These two families replace each other in their
distribution over the globe.</p>

<p>Nearly all the <i>Pleuronectidæ</i> (but they are not numerous) belong
to distinct genera, some, however, being remarkably similar in general
form to the northern <i>Pleuronectes</i>.</p>

<p>With Gadoids <i>Myxinidæ</i> reappear, one species being extremely
similar to the European Myxine. <i>Bdellostoma</i> is a genus peculiar
to the southern temperate zone.</p>

<p>As in the northern temperate zone, so in the southern, the number of
individuals and the variety of forms is much less than between the
tropics. This is especially apparent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span> on comparing the numbers of
species constituting a genus. In this zone genera composed of more than
ten species are the exception, the majority having only from one to
five.</p>

<p>The proportion of genera limited to this zone is rather high; they
will be indicated under the several districts, which we distinguish on
geographical rather than zoological grounds.</p>

<p class="p1">1. The <i>Cape of Good Hope</i> district.</p>

<p>The principal genera found in this district are the following (those
limited to the entire zone being marked with a single (*) and those
peculiar to this district with a double (**) asterisk):—</p>

<p><i>Chimæra</i>, *<i>Callorhynchus</i>, <i>Galeus</i>,
**<i>Leptocarcharias</i>, <i>Scyllium</i>, <i>Acanthias</i>,
<i>Rhinobatus</i>, <i>Torpedo</i>, <i>Narcine</i>, <i>Astrape</i>,
<i>Raja</i>.</p>

<p><i>Serranus</i>, <i>Dentex</i>, <i>Pristipoma</i>; <i>Cantharus</i>,
<i>Box</i>, **<i>Dipterodon</i>, <i>Sagrus</i>, <i>Pagrus</i>,
<i>Pagellus</i>, <i>Chrysophrys</i>; *<i>Chilodactylus</i>;
<i>Sebastes</i>, *<i>Agriopus</i>; <i>Trigla</i>; <i>Sphyræna</i>;
<i>Lepidopus</i>, <i>Thyrsites</i>; <i>Zeus</i>; <i>Caranx</i>;
<i>Lophius</i>; <i>Clinus</i> (10 species), <i>Cristiceps</i>;
**<i>Chorisochismus</i>.</p>

<p>*<i>Halidesmus</i>, *<i>Genypterus</i>, <i>Motella</i>.</p>

<p><i>Syngnathus</i>.—*<i>Bdellostoma</i>.</p>

<p>This list contains many northern forms, which in conjunction with the
peculiarly southern types (<i>Callorhynchus</i>, <i>Chilodactylus</i>,
<i>Agriopus</i>, <i>Clinus</i>, <i>Genypterus</i>, <i>Bdellostoma</i>)
leave no doubt that this district belongs to the southern temperate
zone, whilst the Freshwater fishes of South Africa are members of
the tropical fauna. Only a few (<i>Rhinobatus</i>, <i>Narcine</i>,
<i>Astrape</i>, and <i>Sphyræna</i>) have entered from the neighbouring
tropical coasts. The development of Sparoids is greater than in any of
the other districts of this zone, and may be regarded as one of its
distinguishing features.</p>

<p>2. The <i>South Australian</i> district comprises the southern coasts
of Australia (northwards, about to the latitude of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span> Sydney), Tasmania,
and New Zealand. It is the richest in the southern temperate zone,
partly in consequence of a considerable influx of tropical forms on the
eastern coast of Australia, where they penetrate farther southwards
than should have been expected from merely geographical considerations;
partly in consequence of the thorough manner in which the ichthyology
of New South Wales and New Zealand has been explored. On the other
hand, the western half of the south coast of Australia is still almost
a <i>terra incognita</i>.</p>

<p>The shore-fishes of New Zealand are not so distinct from those of
south-eastern Australia as to deserve to be placed in a separate
district. Beside the genera which enter this zone from the Tropics,
and which are more numerous on the Australian coast than on that of
New Zealand, and beside a few very local genera, the remainder are
identical. Many of the South Australian species, besides, are found
also on the coasts of New Zealand. The principal points of difference
are the extraordinary development of Monacanthus on the coast of South
Australia, and the apparently total absence in Australia of Gadoids,
which in the New Zealand Fauna are represented by six genera.</p>

<p>3. The coast-line of the <i>Chilian district</i> extends over 20
degrees of latitude only, and is nearly straight. In its northern and
warmer parts it is of a very uniform character, and exposed to high and
irregular tides, and to remarkable and sudden changes of the levels of
land and water, which must seriously interfere with fishes living and
propagating near the shore. No river of considerable size interrupts
the monotony of the physical conditions, to offer an additional element
in favour of the development of littoral animals. In the southern
parts, where the coast is lined with archipelagoes, the climate is too
severe for the majority of fishes. All these conditions combine to
render this district comparatively poor as regards variety of Shore
fishes, as will be seen from the following list:—</p>

<p>*Callorhynchus; Scyllium, Acanthias, Spinax; Urolophus.</p>

<p>Serranus, Plectropoma, Polyprion, Pristipoma, Erythrichthys;
*Haplodactylus; *Scorpis; Chilodactylus, **Mendosoma; Sebastes,
*Agriopus; Trigla, Agonus; *Aphritis, *Eleginus, Pinguipes, Latilus,
Notothenia (1 sp.) Umbrina; Thyrsites; Trachurus, Caranx, *Seriolella;
Porichthys; **Myxodes, Clinus; Sicyases, Gobiesox.</p>

<p>Heliastes; **Malacopterus; *Labrichthys.</p>

<p>Merluccius; *Genypterus; Pseudorhombus.</p>

<p>Engraulis, Clupea; Ophichthys, Muræna.</p>

<p>Syngnathus.—*Bdellostoma.</p>

<p>Of these genera six only are not found in other districts of this
zone. Three are peculiar to the Chilian district; <i>Porichthys</i>
and <i>Agonus</i> have penetrated so far southwards from the Peruvian
and Californian districts; and <i>Polyprion</i> is one of those
extraordinary instances in which a very specialised form occurs at
almost opposite points of the globe, without having left a trace of
its previous existence in, or of its passage through, the intermediate
space.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span></p>

<p>4. The <i>Patagonian district</i> is, with the exception of the
neighbourhood of the mouth of the Rio de la Plata, almost unknown.
In that estuary occur <i>Mustelus vulgaris</i>, two <i>Raja</i>,
two <i>Trygon</i>, several Sciænoids, <i>Paropsis signata</i> and
<i>Percophis brasilianus</i> (two fishes peculiar to this coast),
<i>Prionotus punctatus</i>, <i>Læmonema longifilis</i> (a Gadoid),
a <i>Pseudorhombus</i>, two Soles, <i>Engraulis olidus</i>, a
<i>Syngnathus</i>, <i>Conger vulgaris</i>, and <i>Ophichthys
ocellatus</i>; and if we notice the occurrence of a <i>Serranus</i> and
<i>Caranx</i>, of <i>Aphritis</i> and <i>Pinguipes</i>, and of two or
three <i>Clupea</i>, we shall have enumerated all that is known of this
fauna. The fishes of the southern part, viz. the coast of Patagonia
proper, southwards to Magelhæn’s Straits, are unknown; which is the
more to be regretted, as it is most probably the part in which the
characteristic types of this district are most developed.</p>


<h3>V.—<span class="smcap">Shore Fishes of the Antarctic Ocean.</span></h3>

<p>To this fauna we refer the shore fishes of the southernmost extremity
of South America, from 50° lat. S., with Tierra del Fuego and the
Falkland Islands, and those of Kerguelen’s Land, with Prince Edward’s
Island. No fishes are known from the other oceanic islands of these
latitudes.</p>

<p>In the Southern Hemisphere surface fishes do not extend so far towards
the Pole as in the Northern; none are known from beyond 60° lat. S.,
and the Antarctic Fauna, which is analogous to the Arctic Fauna,
inhabits coasts more than ten degrees nearer to the equator. It is
very probable that the shores between 60° and the Antarctic circle
are inhabited by fishes sufficiently numerous to supply part of the
means of subsistence for the large Seals which pass there at least
some season of the year, but hitherto none have been obtained by
naturalists; all that the present state of our knowledge justifies us
in saying is, that the general character of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span> the Fauna of Magelhæn’s
Straits and Kerguelen’s Land is extremely similar to that of Iceland
and Greenland.</p>

<p>As in the arctic Fauna, Chondropterygians are scarce, and
represented by <i>Acanthias vulgaris</i> and species of <i>Raja</i>.
<i>Holocephali</i> have not yet been found so far south, but
<i>Callorhynchus</i>, which is not uncommon near the northern boundary
of this fauna, will prove to extend into it.</p>

<p>As to Acanthopterygians, <i>Cataphracti</i> and <i>Scorpænidæ</i> are
represented as in the arctic Fauna, two of the genera (<i>Sebastes</i>
and <i>Agonus</i>) being identical. The <i>Cottidæ</i> are replaced by
six genera of <i>Trachinidæ</i>, remarkably similar in form to arctic
types; but <i>Discoboli</i> and the characteristic Arctic Blennioids
are absent.</p>

<p>Gadoid Fishes reappear, but are less developed; as usual they are
accompanied by <i>Myxine</i>. The reappearance of so specialised a
genus as <i>Lycodes</i> is most remarkable. Flat-fishes are scarce as
in the North, and belong to peculiar genera.</p>

<p>Physostomes are probably not entirely absent, but hitherto none have
been met with so far south. Lophobranchs are scarce, as in the Arctic
zone; however, it is noteworthy that a peculiar genus, with persistent
embryonic characters (<i>Protocampus</i>), is rather common on the
shores of the Falkland Islands.</p>

<p>The following are the genera known from this zone. Those with a
single asterisk (*) are known to extend into the Temperate zone, but
not beyond it; those with a double asterisk (**) are limited to the
Antarctic shores:—</p>

<h2 class="smaller">CHAPTER XX.<br>
<span class="subhed">DISTRIBUTION OF PELAGIC FISHES.</span></h2></div>

<p>Pelagic Fishes,—that is, fishes inhabiting the surface of mid-ocean
(see p. 255), belong to various orders, viz. Chondropterygians,
Acanthopterygians, Physostomes, Lophobranchs, and Plectognaths. But
neither Anacanths nor Pharyngognaths contribute to this series of the
Marine Fauna. The following genera and families are included in it:—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chondropterygii</span>: Carcharias, Galeocerdo, Thalassorhinus,
Zygæna, Triænodon, Lamnidæ, Rhinodon, Notidanidæ, Læmargus,
Euprotomicrus, Echinorhinus, Isistius; Myliobatidæ.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Acanthopterygii</span>: Dactylopterus, Micropteryx, Scombrina,
Gastrochisma, Nomeus, Centrolophus, Coryphænina, Seriola, Temnodon,
Naucrates, Psenes, Xiphiidæ, Antennarius.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Physostomi</span>: Sternoptychidæ, Scopelus, Astronesthes,
Scombresocidæ (majority).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lophobranchii</span>: Hippocampus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plectognathi</span>: Orthagoriscus, and some other Gymnodonts.</p>

<p>Pelagic fishes differ much from one another in their mode of life. The
majority are excellent swimmers, which not only can move with great
rapidity, but also are possessed of great powers of endurance, and are
thus enabled to continue their course for weeks, apparently without
the necessity of rest: such are many Sharks, Scombroids, Dolphins,
Pilot-fish, Sword-fishes. In some, as in <i>Dactylopterus</i> and
<i>Exocoetus</i>, the ability of taking flying leaps out of the water
is superadded to the power of swimming (Flying-fishes). But in others
the power<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span> of swimming is greatly reduced, as in <i>Antennarius</i>,
<i>Hippocampus</i>, and Gymnodonts; they frequent places in the
ocean covered with floating seaweed, or drift on the surface without
resistance, at the mercy of wind and current. The <i>Echeneis</i>
or Sucking-fishes attach themselves to other large fish, ships, or
floating objects, and allow themselves to be carried about, unless
change of climate or want of food obliges them to abandon their
temporary carrier. Finally, another class of Pelagic fishes come to
the surface of the ocean during the night only; in the day time they
descend to some depth, where they are undisturbed by the rays of the
sun or the agitation of the surface-water: such are <i>Brama</i>, the
<i>Sternoptychidæ</i>, <i>Scopelus</i>, <i>Astronesthes</i>; fishes,
the majority of which are provided with those extraordinary luminary
organs that we find so much developed in the true Deep-sea fishes.
Indeed, this last kind of Pelagic fishes forms a passage to the
Deep-sea forms.</p>

<p>Pelagic fishes, like shore fishes, are most numerous in the Tropical
Zone; and, with few exceptions (<i>Echinorhinus</i>, <i>Psenes</i>,
<i>Sternoptychidæ</i>, <i>Astronesthes</i>), the same genera are
represented in the tropical Atlantic as well as in the Indo-Pacific.
The number of identical species occurring in both these oceans is
great, and probably still greater than would appear from systematic
lists, in which there are retained many specific names that were given
at a time when species were believed to have a very limited range.
The Pelagic fauna of the tropics gradually passes into that of the
temperate zones, only a few genera, like <i>Cybium</i>, <i>Psenes</i>,
<i>Antennarius</i>, being almost entirely confined to the tropics. All
the other tropical genera range into the temperate zones, but their
representatives become scarcer with the increasing distance from the
equator. North of 40° lat. N. many genera have disappeared, or are met
with in isolated examples only, as <i>Carcharias</i>, <i>Zygæna</i>,
<i>Notidanus</i>, <i>Myliobatidæ</i>, <i>Dactylopterus</i>,
<i>Echeneis</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span> <i>Nomeus</i>, <i>Coryphæna</i>, <i>Schedophilus</i>,
<i>Seriola</i>, <i>Temnodon</i>, <i>Antennarius</i>,
<i>Sternoptychidæ</i>, <i>Astronesthes</i>, <i>Exocoetus</i>,
<i>Tetrodon</i>, <i>Diodon</i>; and only one genus of Sharks,
<i>Galeocerdo</i>, approaches the Arctic circle. Some few species, like
<i>Antennarius</i>, <i>Scopelus</i>, are carried by currents near to
the northern confines of the temperate zones; but such occurrences are
accidental, and these fishes must be regarded as entirely foreign to
the fauna of those latitudes. On the other hand, some Pelagic fishes
inhabit the temperate zones, whilst their occurrence within the tropics
is very problematical; thus, in the Atlantic, <i>Thalassorhinus</i>,
<i>Selache</i>, <i>Læmargus</i>, <i>Centrolophus</i>, <i>Diana</i>,
<i>Ausonia</i>, <i>Lampris</i> (all genera composed of one or two
species only). Beside the Shark mentioned, no other Pelagic fishes are
known from the Arctic Ocean.</p>

<p>We possess very little information about the Pelagic fish-fauna of
the Southern oceans. So much only is certain, that the tropical forms
<i>gradually</i> disappear; but it would be hazardous, in the present
state of our knowledge, to state even approximately, the limits of
the southward range of a single genus. Scarcely more is known about
the appearance of types peculiar to the Southern temperate zone; for
instance, the gigantic Shark (<i>Rhinodon</i>), representing the
Northern Selache, near the coasts of South Africa, and the Scombroid
genus, <i>Gastrochisma</i>, in the South Pacific.</p>

<p>The largest of marine fishes, <i>Rhinodon</i>, <i>Selache</i>,
<i>Carcharodon</i>, <i>Myliobatidæ</i>, <i>Thynnus</i>,
<i>Xiphiidæ</i>, <i>Orthagoriscus</i>, belong to the Pelagic Fauna.
Young fishes are frequently found in mid-ocean, which are the offspring
of shore-fishes normally depositing their spawn near the coast. The
manner, in which this fry passes into the open sea, is unknown; for it
has not yet been ascertained whether it is carried by currents from
the place where it was deposited originally, or whether shore-fishes
sometimes spawn at a distance from the coast. We may remember that
shore-fishes inhabit not only coasts but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span> also submerged banks with
some depth of water above, and that, by the action of the water,
spawn deposited on these latter localities is very liable to be
dispersed over wide areas of the ocean. Embryoes of at least some
shore-fishes hatched under abnormal conditions seem to have an abnormal
growth up to a certain period of their life, when they perish. The
<i>Leptocephali</i> must be regarded as such abnormally developed
fish (see p. 179). Fishes of a similar condition are the so-called
Pelagic <i>Plagusiæ</i>, young Pleuronectoids, the origin of which is
still unknown. As mentioned before, Flat-fishes, like all the other
Anacanths, are otherwise not represented in the Pelagic fauna.</p>

<h2 class="smaller">CHAPTER XXI.<br>
<span class="subhed">THE FISHES OF THE DEEP SEA.</span></h2></div>

<p>The knowledge of the existence of deep-sea fishes is one of the
recent discoveries of ichthyology. It is only about twenty years ago
that, from the evidence afforded by the anatomical structure of a
few singular fishes obtained in the North Atlantic, an opinion was
expressed that these fishes inhabited great depths of the ocean, and
that their organisation was specially adapted for living under the
physical abyssal conditions. These fishes agreed in the character
of their connective tissue, which was so extremely weak as to yield
to, and to break under, the slightest pressure, so that the greatest
difficulty is experienced to preserve their body in its continuity.
Another singular circumstance was, that some of the specimens were
picked up floating on the surface of the water, having met their
deaths whilst engaged in swallowing or digesting another fish not much
inferior or even superior in size to themselves.</p>

<p>The first peculiarity was accounted for by the fact that, if those
fishes really inhabited the great depths supposed, their removal from
the enormous pressure under which they lived would be accompanied by
such an expansion of gases within their tissues as to rupture them, and
to cause a separation of the parts which had been held together by the
pressure. The second circumstance was explained thus:—A raptatorial
fish organised to live at a depth of between 500 and 800 fathoms seizes
another usually inhabiting a depth of between 300 and 500 fathoms. In
its struggles to escape,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span> the fish seized, nearly as large or strong as
the attacking fish, carries the latter out of its depth into a higher
stratum, where the diminished pressure causes such an expansion of
gases as to make the destroyer with its victim rise with increasing
rapidity towards the surface, which they reach dead or in a dying
condition. Specimens in this condition are not rarely picked up; and
as, of course, comparatively few can by accident fall into the hands of
naturalists, occurrences of the kind related must happen very often.</p>

<p>Thus, the existence of fishes peculiarly adapted for the deep sea has
been a fact maintained and admitted for some time in Ichthyology; and
as the same genera and species were found at very distant parts of
the ocean, it was further stated that those Deep-sea fishes were not
limited in their range, and that, consequently, the physical conditions
of the depths of the ocean must be the same or nearly the same over
the whole globe. That Deep-sea fishes were not of a peculiar order,
but chiefly modified forms of surface types, was another conclusion
arrived at from the sporadic evidence collected during the period which
preceded systematic deep-sea dredging.</p>

<p>However, nothing was positively known as to the exact depths inhabited
by those fishes until observations were made during the voyage of
H.M.S. “Challenger.” The results obtained by this expedition afforded a
surer and more extended basis for our knowledge of Deep-sea fishes.</p>

<p>The physical conditions of the deep sea, which must affect the
organisation and distribution of fishes, are the following:—</p>

<p>1. Absence of sunlight. Probably the rays of the sun do not penetrate
to, and certainly do not extend beyond, a depth of 200 fathoms,
therefore we may consider this to be the depth where the Deep-sea
fauna commences. Absence of light is, of necessity, accompanied by
modifications of the organs of vision and by simplification of colours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span></p>

<p>2. The absence of sunlight is in some measure compensated for by the
presence of phosphorescent light, produced by many marine animals, and
also by numerous Deep-sea fishes.</p>

<p>3. Depression and equality of the temperature. At a depth of 500
fathoms the temperature of the water is already as low as 40° Fahr.,
and perfectly independent of the temperature of the surface-water; and
from the greatest depths upwards to about 1000 fathoms the temperature
is uniformly but a few degrees above freezing-point. Temperature,
therefore, ceases to offer an obstacle to the unlimited dispersal of
Deep-sea fishes.</p>

<p>4. The increased pressure by the water. The pressure of the atmosphere
on the level of the sea amounts to fifteen pounds per square inch of
the surface of the body of an animal; but the pressure amounts to a ton
weight for every 1000 fathoms of depth.</p>

<p>5. With the sunlight, vegetable life ceases in the depths of the sea.
All Deep-sea fishes are therefore carnivorous; the most voracious
feeding frequently on their own offspring, and the toothless kinds
being nourished by the animalcules which live on the bottom, or which,
“like a constant rain,” settle down from the upper strata towards the
bottom of the sea.</p>

<p>6. The perfect quiet of the water at great depths. The agitation of
the water, caused by the disturbances of the air, does not extend
beyond the depth of a few fathoms; below this surface-stratum there is
no other movement except the quiet flow of ocean-currents, and near
the bottom of the deep sea the water is probably in a state of almost
entire quiescence.</p>

<p>The effect upon fishes of the physical conditions described is
clearly testified by the modification of one or more parts of their
organisation, so that every Deep-sea fish may be recognised as such,
without the accompanying positive evidence that it has been caught
at a great depth; and <i>vice versa</i>, fishes reputed to have been
obtained at a great depth, and not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span> having any of the characteristics
of the dwellers of the deep sea, must be regarded as surface-fishes.</p>

<p>The most striking characteristic, found in many Deep-sea fishes,
is in relation to the tremendous pressure under which they live.
Their osseous and muscular systems are, as compared with the same
parts of surface-fishes, very feebly developed. The bones have a
fibrous, fissured, and cavernous texture; are light, with scarcely
any calcareous matter, so that the point of a needle will readily
penetrate them without breaking. The bones, especially the vertebræ,
appear to be most loosely connected with one another; and it requires
the most careful handling to prevent the breaking of the connective
ligaments. The muscles, especially the great lateral muscles of the
trunk and tail, are thin, the fascicles being readily separated from
one another or torn, the connective tissue being extremely loose,
feeble, or apparently absent. This peculiarity has been observed
in the <i>Trachypteridæ</i>, <i>Plagyodus</i>, <i>Chiasmodus</i>,
<i>Melanocetus</i>, <i>Saccopharynx</i>. But we cannot assume that
it actually obtains whilst those fishes exist under their natural
conditions. Some of them are most rapacious creatures which must be
able to execute rapid and powerful movements to catch and overpower
their prey; and for that object their muscular system, thin as its
layers may be, must be as firm, and the chain of the segments of their
vertebral column as firmly linked together as in surface-fishes.
Therefore, it is evident that the change which the body of those fishes
has undergone on their withdrawal from the pressure under which they
live is a much aggravated form of the affection that is experienced
by persons reaching great altitudes in their ascent of a mountain
or in a balloon. In every living organism with an intestinal tract
there are accumulations of free gases; and, moreover, the blood and
other fluids, which permeate every part of the body, contain gases
in solution. Under greatly diminished pressure these gases<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span> expand,
so that, if the withdrawal from a depth is not an extremely slow and
gradual process, the various tissues must be distended, loosened,
ruptured; and what is a vigorous fish at a depth of 500 or more
fathoms, appears at the surface as a loosely-jointed body which, if the
skin is not of sufficient toughness, can only be kept together with
difficulty. At great depths a fibrous osseous structure and a thin
layer of muscles suffices to obtain the same results for which, at the
surface, thickness of muscle and firm osseous or cartilaginous tissue
are necessary.</p>

<p>The muciferous system of many Deep-sea fishes is developed in an
extraordinary degree. We find already in fishes which are comparatively
little removed from the surface (that is to depths of 100–200
fathoms), the lateral line much wider than in their congeners or
nearest allies which live on the surface, as in <i>Trachichthys</i>,
<i>Hoplostethus</i>, many <i>Scorpænidæ</i>. But in fishes inhabiting
depths of 1000 and more fathoms, the whole muciferous system is
dilated; it is especially the surface of the skull which is occupied by
large cavities (<i>Macruridæ</i>, deep-sea <i>Ophidiidæ</i>), and the
whole body seems to be covered with a layer of mucus. These cavities
collapse and shrink in specimens which have been preserved in spirit
for some time, but a re-immersion in water for a short time generally
suffices to show the immense quantity of mucus secreted by them. The
physiological use of this secretion is unknown; it has been observed to
have phosphorescent properties in perfectly fresh specimens.</p>

<p>The colours of Deep-sea fishes are extremely simple, their bodies
being either black or silvery; in a few only are some filaments or the
fin-rays of a bright scarlet colour. Among the black forms albinoes are
not scarce.</p>

<p>The organ of sight is the first to be affected by a sojourn in deep
water. Even in fishes which habitually live at a depth of only 80
fathoms, we find the eye of a proportionally larger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span> size than in
their representatives at the surface. In such fishes the eyes increase
in size with the depth inhabited by them, down to the depth of 200
fathoms, the large eyes being necessary to collect as many rays of
light as possible. Beyond that depth small-eyed fishes as well as
large-eyed occur, the former having their want of vision compensated
for by tentacular organs of touch, whilst the latter have no such
accessory organs, and evidently see only by the aid of phosphorescence.
In the greatest depths blind fishes occur with rudimentary eyes and
without special organs of touch.</p>

<p>Many fishes of the deep sea are provided with more or less numerous,
round, shining, mother-of-pearl-coloured bodies, imbedded in the skin.
These so-called phosphorescent or luminous organs are either larger
bodies of an oval or irregularly elliptical shape placed on the head,
in the vicinity of the eye, or smaller round globular bodies arranged
symmetrically in series along the side of the body and tail, especially
near the abdominal profile, less frequently along the back. The former
have not yet been anatomically examined. The number of pairs of the
latter is in direct relation to that of the segments of the vertebral
column, the muscular system, etc. (meta*-meres); and two kinds may be
distinguished differing from each other in their anatomical structure.
The organs of one kind consist of an anterior, biconvex, lens-like
body, which is transparent during life, simple or composed of rods
(<i>Chauliodus</i>); and of a posterior chamber which is filled with
a transparent fluid, and coated with a dark membrane composed of
hexagonal cells, or of rods arranged as in a retina. This structure
is found in <i>Astronesthes</i>, <i>Stomias</i>, <i>Chauliodus</i>,
etc. In the other kind the organ shows throughout a simply glandular
structure, but apparently without an efferent duct (<i>Gonostoma</i>,
<i>Scopelus</i>, <i>Maurolicus</i>, <i>Argyropelecus</i>). Branches
of the spinal nerves run to each organ, and are distributed over the
retina-like membrane or the glandular follicles. The former kind
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span> organs are considered by some naturalists true organs of vision
(accessory eyes), the function of the latter being left unexplained by
them.</p>

<p>Although, thus, these organs morphologically differ from each other,
there is no doubt that the functions of all have some relation to the
peculiar conditions of light under which the fishes provided with them
live; these fishes being either deep-sea forms or nocturnal pelagic
kinds. There are three possible hypotheses as to the function of these
organs:—</p>

<p>1. All the different kinds of organs are sensory, or, in other words,
accessory eyes.</p>

<p>2. Only the organs with a lenticular body are sensory, and those with a
glandular structure produce and emit phosphorescent light.</p>

<p>3. All are producers of light.</p>

<p>There are very serious objections to adopting the first view.
<i>Scopelus</i> and <i>Argyropelecus</i> possess not only perfectly
developed, but even large eyes, specially adapted for a nocturnal
life; and therefore accessory organs of vision must appear to be
quite superfluous to them. On the other hand, in Deep-sea fishes
without external eyes, which would seem to especially require these
metameric organs of sense, they are invariably absent. And, finally,
it is quite inconceivable that the glandular structures should have
the faculty of conveying impressions of light to the nervous centre.
The second supposition seems therefore to be nearer the truth; and
is supported by the fact that the glandular organs of Scopeli have
actually been observed to gleam with phosphorescent light, and by the
obvious morphological similarity of the organs with a lenticular body
and retina-like membrane to an organ of vision. We are, moreover,
justified, from an <i>à priori</i> consideration, in supposing that
in depths to which no sunlight descends, and which are illuminated by
phosphorescent light only, peculiar organs of vision would have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
developed. On the other hand, this supposition is opposed by the fact
that many fishes which dwell in those abyssal depths are provided
with large ordinary eyes (as the <i>Trachypteri</i>, the majority of
<i>Macruridæ</i>), and, therefore, that the ordinary organ of vision is
quite sufficient for seeing by phosphorescent light. Thus, whilst we
must admit that those compound organs may prove to be organs of sense,
we maintain at the same time that their morphological nature is not
opposed to the belief that they too, like the glandular organs, are
producers of light. It may be produced at the bottom of the posterior
chamber, and emitted through the lenticular body in particular
directions, with the same effect as light is sent through the convex
glass of a “bull’s eye.” This hypothesis seems to be less bold than the
other, which would require us to believe that vertebrate animals, with
a nervous centre specialised for the reception of the impressions of
the higher senses, should receive them through the spinal chord.</p>

augenaehnlichen Flecken einiger Knochenfische.” St. Petersburg,
Bullet. 1879.]</p>
</div>

<p>Whenever we find in a fish long delicate filaments, developed in
connection with the fins or the extremity of the tail, we may
conclude that it is an inhabitant of still water and of quiet habits.
Many deep-sea fishes (<i>Trachypteridæ</i>, <i>Macruridæ</i>,
<i>Ophidiidæ</i>, <i>Bathypterois</i>) are provided with such
filamentous prolongations, the development of which is perfectly in
accordance with their sojourn in the absolutely quiet waters of abyssal
depths.</p>

<p>Some of the raptatorial Deep-sea fishes have a stomach so distensible
and capacious that it can receive a fish of twice or thrice the
bulk of the destroyer (<i>Melanocetus</i>, <i>Chiasmodus</i>,
<i>Saccopharynx</i>). Deglutition is performed in them not by means of
the muscles of the pharynx, as in other fishes, but by the independent
and alternate action of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span> jaws, as in Snakes. These fishes cannot
be said to swallow their food, but rather draw themselves over their
victim, in the fashion of an <i>Actinia</i>.</p>

<p>Before the voyage of H.M.S. “Challenger,” scarcely thirty Deep-sea
fishes were known. This number is now much increased by the discovery
of many new species and genera; but, singularly, no new types of
families were discovered: nothing but what might have been expected
from our previous knowledge of this group of fishes. Modifications of
certain organs, perfectly novel, and of the greatest interest, were
found, as we shall see in the “Systematic Part;” but the most important
results of this voyage are that the general character of the abyssal
fish-fauna, the abundance of fishes, and the exact depths to which
fishes may descend, have been ascertained.</p>

<p>However, the statements of the depths at which the fishes collected by
the “Challenger” were taken cannot be received without some critical
examination of each individual species. No precaution was taken to
keep the mouth of the dredge closed during its descent or ascent,
and therefore it is quite within the limits of probability that
sometimes fishes were accidentally enclosed within the dredge, whilst
it was traversing the surface strata. And this has happened more
than once; for it is quite certain that common surface fishes like
<i>Sternoptyx</i> and <i>Astronestles</i>, never ranged to a depth of
2500 fathoms. On the other hand, the majority of the fishes obtained
offer sufficient evidence from their own organisation that they live
on the bottom, and are unable to support themselves in the water at a
certain distance from the bottom or surface; and, consequently, that
they actually were obtained at the depth to which the dredge descended.</p>

<p>As far as the observations go at present, no distinct bathymetrical
regions, which would be characterised by peculiar forms, can be
defined. The depths from 200 to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span> 600 fathoms are inhabited by
numerous forms, still strongly reminding us of surface types. To this
fauna belong the few Chondropterygians of the deep sea, a Sebastes
and Setarches, a Beryx and Polymixia, a Cottus, etc.; but they are
associated with many others which descend to the greatest depths.
And before anything like a division into bathymetrical zones can be
attempted, the observations of the “Challenger” expedition must be
confirmed and supplemented by other series of similar systematic
observations. One of the most startling conclusions at which we would
have to arrive from the “Challenger” observations is, that some of the
species of Deep-sea fishes would range from a depth of some 300 fathoms
down to one of 2000 fathoms; or, in other words, that a fish which
has once attained in its organisation to that modification by which
it is enabled to exist under the pressure of half a ton, can easily
accommodate itself to one of two tons or more,—a conclusion which is
not in accordance with anatomical facts, and which must be confirmed by
other observations before we can adopt it. But if the vertical range of
Deep-sea fishes is actually as it appears from the “Challenger” lists,
then there is no more distinct vertical than horizontal distribution of
Deep-sea fishes.</p>

<p>The greatest depth reached hitherto by a dredge in which fishes were
enclosed is 2900 fathoms. But the specimens thus obtained belong to
a species (<i>Gonostoma microdon</i>), which seems to be extremely
abundant in upper strata of the Atlantic and Pacific, and were
therefore most likely caught by the dredge in its ascent. The next
greatest depth, viz., 2750 fathoms, must be accepted as one at which
fishes undoubtedly do live; the fish obtained from this depth of the
Atlantic, <i>Bathyophis ferox</i>, showing by its whole habit that it
is a form living on the bottom of the ocean.</p>

<p>The fish-fauna of the deep sea is composed chiefly of forms or
modifications of forms which we find represented at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span> the surface in the
cold and temperate zones, or which appear as nocturnal pelagic forms.
The Chondropterygians are few in number, not descending to a depth of
more than 600 fathoms. The Acanthopterygians, which form the majority
of the coast and surface faunas, are also scantily represented; genera
identical with surface types are confined to the same inconsiderable
depths as the Chondropterygians, whilst those Acanthopterygians which
are so much specialised for the life in the deep sea as to deserve
generic separation, range from 200 to 2400 fathoms. Three distinct
families of Acanthopterygians belong to the deep-sea fauna, viz.
<i>Trachypteridæ</i>, <i>Lophotidæ</i>, and <i>Notacanthidæ</i>; they
respectively consist of three, one, or two genera only.</p>

<p><i>Gadidæ</i>, <i>Ophidiidæ</i>, and <i>Macruridæ</i> are very
numerous, ranging through all depths; they constitute about one-fourth
of the whole deep-sea fauna.</p>

<p>Of <i>Physostomi</i>, the families of <i>Sternoptychidæ</i>,
<i>Scopelidæ</i>, <i>Stomiatidæ</i>, <i>Salmonidæ</i>,
<i>Bathythrissidæ</i>, <i>Alepocephalidæ</i>, <i>Halosauridæ</i>,
and <i>Murænidæ</i> are represented. Of these the <i>Scopeloids</i>
are the most numerous, constituting nearly another fourth of
the fauna. <i>Salmonidæ</i> are scarce, with three small genera
only. <i>Bathythrissidæ</i> include one species only, which is
probably confined in its vertical as well as horizontal range; it
occurs at a depth of about 350 fathoms in the sea of Japan. The
<i>Alepocephalidæ</i> and <i>Halosauridæ</i>, known before the
“Challenger” expedition from isolated examples only, prove to be true,
widely-spread, deep-sea types. Eels are well represented, and seem to
descend to the greatest depths.</p>

<p><i>Myxine</i> has been obtained from a depth of 345 fathoms.</p>

<p>It will be useful to append a complete list of Deep-sea fishes, with
the depths as ascertained by the dredgings of the “Challenger:”—</p>

<p>The Class of Fishes is divided into four sub-classes:—</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">Palæichthyes</span>.—Heart with a contractile conus arteriosus;
intestine with a spiral valve; optic nerves non-decussating, or only
partially decussating.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">Teleostei</span>.—Heart with a non-contractile bulbus
arteriosus; intestine without spiral valve; optic nerves decussating.
Skeleton ossified, with completely separated vertebræ.</p>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">Cyclostomata</span>.—Heart without bulbus arteriosus; intestine
simple. Skeleton cartilaginous and notochordal. One nasal aperture
only. No jaws; mouth surrounded by a circular lip.</p>

<p>IV. <span class="smcap">Leptocardii</span>.—Heart replaced by pulsating sinuses;
intestine simple. Skeleton membrano-cartilaginous and notochordal. No
skull; no brain.</p>


<h3 class="smaller">FIRST SUB-CLASS: PALÆICHTHYES.</h3>

<p><i>Heart with a contractile conus arteriosus;<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> intestine with a
spiral valve;<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> optic nerves non-decussating, or only partially
decussating;<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> skeleton cartilaginous or osseous.</i></p>

<p>This sub-class comprises the Sharks and Rays, and the Ganoid fishes.
Although based upon a singular concurrence of most important
characters, its members exhibit as great a diversity of form, and as
manifold modifications in the remainder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span> of their organisation as the
<i>Teleostei</i>. The <i>Palæichthyes</i> stand to the <i>Teleostei</i>
in the same relation as the Marsupials to the Placentalia.
Geologically, as a sub-class, they were the predecessors of Teleosteous
fishes; and it is a remarkable fact that all those modifications which
show an approach of the ichthyic type to the Batrachians are found in
this sub-class. We divide it into two orders: <i>Chondropterygii</i>
and <i>Ganoidei</i>.</p>


<h4 class="smaller">FIRST ORDER: CHONDROPTERYGII.</h4>

<p><i>Skeleton cartilaginous. Body with medial and paired fins, the
hinder pair abdominal. Vertebral column generally heterocercal, the
upper lobe of the caudal fin produced. Gills attached to the skin by
the outer margin, with several intervening gill-openings: rarely one
external gill-opening only. No gill-cover. No air-bladder. Two, three,
or more series of valves in the conus arteriosus. Ova large and few
in number,<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> impregnated and, in some species, developed within a
uterine cavity. Embryo with deciduous external gills.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Males with
intromittent organs attached to the ventral fins.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></i></p>

<p>This order, for which, also, the name <i>Elasmobranchii</i> has
been proposed (by Bonaparte), comprises the Sharks and Rays and
Chimæras, and is divided into two suborders: <i>Plagiostomata</i> and
<i>Holocephala</i>.</p>


<h5 class="smaller">FIRST SUB-ORDER: PLAGIOSTOMATA.</h5>

<p><i>From five to seven gill-openings. Skull with a suspensorium and the
palatal apparatus detached. Teeth numerous.</i></p>

<p>The Plagiostomes differ greatly among each other with regard to the
general form of their body: in the Sharks or <i>Selachoidei</i> the
body is elongate, more or less cylindrical, gradually passing into the
tail; their gill-openings are lateral. In the Rays, or <i>Batoidei</i>,
the gill-openings are always placed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span> on the abdominal aspect of the
fish; the body is depressed, and the trunk, which is surrounded by the
immensely developed pectoral fins, forms a broad flat disk, of which
the tail appears as a thin and slender appendage. Spiracles are always
present; the number of gill-openings is constantly five; no anal fin;
dorsal fins, if present, situated on the tail. However, some of the
Rays approach the Sharks in having the caudal portion less abruptly
contracted behind the trunk.</p>

<p>Fossil Plagiostomes are very numerous in all formations. Some of
the earliest determinable fish remains are believed to be, or are,
derived from Plagiostomes. Those which can be referred to any of
the following families will be mentioned subsequently: but there
are others, especially fin-spines, which leave us in doubt to
which group of Plagiostomes their owners had any affinity, thus
<i>Onchus</i> from the upper Silurian, continuing to carboniferous
formations; <i>Dimeracanthus</i>, <i>Homocanthus</i>, from the
Devonian; <i>Oracanthus</i>, <i>Gyracanthus</i>, <i>Tristychius</i>,
<i>Astroptychius</i>, <i>Ptychacanthus</i>, <i>Sphenacanthus</i>,
etc., from carboniferous formations; <i>Leptacanthus</i>, from
the coal to the Oolite; <i>Cladacanthus</i>, <i>Cricacanthus</i>,
<i>Gyropristis</i>, and <i>Lepracanthus</i>, from the coal
measures; <i>Nemacanthus</i>, <i>Liacanthus</i>, from the Trias;
<i>Astracanthus</i>, <i>Myriacanthus</i>, <i>Pristacanthus</i>, from
the Jurassic group.</p>


<h6>A. <span class="smcap">Selachoidei: Sharks.</span></h6>

<p>The elongate cylindrical body, generally terminating in a more or
less pointed snout, and passing into a powerful and flexible tail,
blade-like at its extremity, gives to the Sharks a most extraordinary
power of swimming, with regard to endurance as well as rapidity of
motion. Many, especially the larger kinds, inhabit the open ocean,
following ships for weeks, or pursuing shoals of fishes in their
periodical migrations. Other large-sized sharks frequent such parts
of the coast as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span> offer them abundance of food; whilst the majority of
the smaller kinds are shore fishes, rarely leaving the bottom, and
sometimes congregating in immense numbers. The movements of sharks
resemble in some measure those of snakes, their flexible body being
bent in more than one curve when moving.</p>

<p>Sharks are most numerous in the seas between the Tropics, and become
scarcer beyond, a few only reaching the Arctic circle; it is not known
how far they advance southwards towards the Antarctic region. Some
species enter fresh waters, and ascend large rivers, like the Tigris
or Ganges, to a considerable distance. The pelagic as well as the
shore species have a wide geographical range. Very few descend to a
considerable depth, probably not exceeding 500 fathoms. There are about
140 different species known.</p>

<p>Sharks have no scales like those of other fishes; their integuments
are covered with calcified papillæ which, under the microscope, show a
structure similar to that of teeth. If the papillæ are small, pointed,
and close set, the skin is called “shagreen;” rarely they are larger,
appearing as bucklers or spines, of various sizes.</p>

<p>These fishes are exclusively carnivorous, and those armed with powerful
cutting teeth are the most formidable tyrants of the ocean. They have
been known to divide the body of a man in two at one bite, as if by
the sweep of a sword. Some of the largest sharks, however, which
are provided with very small teeth, are almost harmless, feeding on
small fishes only or marine invertebrates. Others, particularly of
the smaller kinds, commonly called “Dog-fishes,” have short or obtuse
teeth, and feed on shells or any other animal substance. Sharks scent
their food from a distance, being readily attracted by the smell of
blood or decomposing bodies.</p>

<p>In China and Japan, and many other eastern countries, the smaller kinds
of sharks are eaten. Sharks’ fins form in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span> India and China a very
important article of trade, the Chinese preparing from them gelatine,
and using the better sorts for culinary purposes. The fins are obtained
not exclusively from Sharks but also from Rays, and assorted in two
kinds, viz. “white and black.” The white consist exclusively of the
dorsal fins, which are on both sides of the same uniform light colour,
and reputed to yield more gelatine than the other fins. The pectoral,
ventral, and anal fins pass under the denomination of black fins; the
caudal fin is not used. One of the principal places where shark fishery
is practised as a profession is Kurrachee. Dr. Buist, writing in 1850
(“Proc. Zool. Soc.” 1850, p. 100), states that there are thirteen
large boats, with crews of twelve men each, constantly employed in
this pursuit; that the value of the fins sent to the market varies
from 15,000 to 18,000 rupees; that one boat will sometimes capture at
a draught as many as one hundred sharks of various sizes; and that the
number total of sharks captured during the year amounts probably to not
less than 40,000. Large quantities are imported from the African coast
and the Arabian Gulf, and various ports on the coast of India. In the
year 1845–46, 8770 cwt. of sharks’ fins were exported from Bombay to
China.</p>


<h6 class="smcap">First Family—Carchariidæ.</h6>

<p><i>Eye with a nictitating membrane. Mouth crescent-shaped, inferior.
Anal fin present. Two dorsal fins, the first opposite to the space
between pectoral and ventral fins, without spine in front.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Carcharias.</span>—Snout produced in the longitudinal axis
of the body; mouth armed with a series of large flat triangular
teeth, which have a smooth cutting or serrated edge. Spiracles
absent. A transverse pit on the back of the tail, at the root of
the caudal fin.</p>
</div>

<p>This genus comprises the true Sharks, common in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span> tropical, but
less so in the temperate seas. Between thirty and forty different
species have been distinguished, of which one of the most common is
the “Blue Shark” (<i>Carcharias glaucus</i>). Individuals of from
twelve to fifteen feet are of very common occurrence, but some of
the species attain a much larger size, and a length of 25 and more
feet. Fishes of this genus or of closely allied genera (<i>Corax</i>,
<i>Hemipristis</i>) are not uncommon in the chalk and tertiary
formations.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Galeocerdo.</span>—Teeth large, flat, triangular, oblique,
serrated on both edges, with a deep notch on the outer margin.
Spiracles small. A pit on the tail, above and below, at the root
of the caudal fin. Two notches on the under caudal border, one
of them at the end of the spine.</p>
</div>

  <div class="figcenter" id="fig112" style="max-width: 385px">

     alt="">
     <p class="p0 center smaller">Fig. 112.—Dentition of the Blue Shark (Carcharias
glaucus); the single teeth are of the natural size.</p>
  </div>

<p>Three species, of which one (<i>G. arcticus</i>) is confined to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span> the
arctic and sub-arctic oceans. The others inhabit temperate and tropical
seas, and all attain to a very large size.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Galeus.</span>—Snout produced in the longitudinal axis of the
body; teeth equal in both jaws, rather small, flat, triangular,
oblique, serrated and with a notch. Spiracles small. No pit at
the commencement of the caudal fin, which has a single notch on
its lower margin.</p>
</div>

<p>These are small sharks, commonly called “Tope.” The species found on
the British coast is spread over nearly all the temperate and tropical
seas, and is common in California and Tasmania. It lives on the bottom,
and is very troublesome to fishermen by constantly taking away bait or
driving away the fishes which they desire to catch.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Zygæna.</span>—The anterior part of the head is broad,
flattened, and produced into a lobe on each side, the extremity
of which is occupied by the eye. Caudal fin with a single notch
at its lower margin. A pit at the root of the caudal fin.
Spiracles none. Nostrils situated on the front edge of the head.</p>
</div>

<p>The “Hammerheads,” or Hammerheaded Sharks, have a dentition very
similar to that of <i>Carcharias</i>, and although they do not
attain to the same large size, they belong to the most formidable
fishes of the ocean. The peculiar form of their head is quite unique
among fishes; young examples have the lateral extension of the skull
much less developed than adults. Five species are known, which are
most abundant in the tropics. By far the most common is <i>Zygæna
malleus</i>, which occurs in nearly all tropical and sub-tropical seas.
Specimens of this species may be often seen ascending from the clear
blue depths of the ocean like a great cloud. Cantor found in a female,
nearly 11 feet long, thirty-seven embryons.—Hammerheads have lived
from the cretaceous epoch.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Mustelus.</span>—The second dorsal fin is not much smaller
than the first. No pit at the root of the caudal, which is
without distinct lower lobe. Snout produced in the longitudinal
axis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span> of the body. Spiracles small, behind the eyes. Teeth
small, numerous, similar in both jaws, obtuse, or with very
indistinct cusps, arranged like pavement.</p>
</div>

<p>The “Hounds” are small Sharks, abundant on the coasts of all the
temperate and tropical seas; two of the five species known occur on
the coasts of Europe, viz. <i>M. lævis</i> and <i>M. vulgaris</i>.
Closely allied as these two species are, they yet show a most singular
difference, viz. that a placenta is developed in the uterus for the
attachment of the embryo in <i>M. lævis</i> (the Γαλεὁς λεȋος of
Aristotle, to whom this fact was already known); whilst the embryons
of <i>M. vulgaris</i> are developed without such placenta (see <i>J.
Müller</i>, “Abhandl. Ak. Wiss.” Berl. 1840). The Hounds are bottom
fish, which feed principally on shells, crustaceans, and decomposing
animal substances.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Several other genera belong to the family Carchariidæ, but it will be
sufficient to mention their names:—<i>Hemigaleus</i>, <i>Loxodon</i>,
<i>Thalassorhinus</i>, <i>Triænodon</i>, <i>Leptocarcharias</i>, and
<i>Triacis</i>.</p>


<h6 class="smcap">Second Family—Lamnidæ.</h6>

<p><i>Eye without nictitating membrane. Anal fin present. Two dorsal fins;
the first opposite to the space between pectoral and ventral fins,
without spine in front. Nostrils not confluent with the mouth which is

<p>All the fishes of this family attain to a very large size, and
are pelagic. But little is known of their reproduction. The first
appearance of this family is indicated by <i>Carcharopsis</i>, a
genus from carboniferous formations, the teeth of which differ from
those of <i>Carcharodon</i> only by having a broad fold at the base.
In the chalk and tertiary formations almost all the existing genera
are represented; and, besides, <i>Oxytes</i>, <i>Sphenodus</i>,
<i>Gomphodus</i>, and <i>Ancistrodon</i>, which are known<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span> from teeth
only, have been considered generically distinct from the living
Porbeagles.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Lamna (Oxyrhina).</span>—The second dorsal and anal are very
small. A pit at the root of the caudal, which has the lower lobe
much developed. Side of the tail with a prominent longitudinal
keel. Mouth wide. Teeth large, lanceolate, not serrated,
sometimes with additional basal cusps. On each side of the upper
jaw, at some distance from the symphysis, there is one or two
teeth conspicuously smaller than the others. Gill-openings very
wide. Spiracles minute.</p>

<p>Of the “Porbeagles,” three species have been described, of which the
one occurring in the North Atlantic, and frequently straying to the
British coasts (<i>L. cornubica</i>), is best known. It attains to a
length of ten feet, and feeds chiefly on fishes; its lanceolate teeth
are not adapted for cutting, but rather for seizing and holding its
prey, which it appears to swallow whole. According to Pennant it is
viviparous; only two embryoes were found in the female which came under
his observation. Haast has found this species also off the coast of New
Zealand.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Carcharodon.</span>—The second dorsal and anal are very
small. Pit at the root of the caudal, which has the lower
lobe well developed. Side of the tail with a prominent
longitudinal keel. Mouth wide. Teeth large, flat, erect,
regularly triangular, serrated. On each side of the upper jaw,
at some distance from the symphysis, there is one or two teeth
conspicuously smaller than the others. Gill-openings wide.</p>
</div>

<p>One species only is known (<i>C. rondeletii</i>), which is the most
formidable of all Sharks. It is strictly pelagic; and appears to occur
in all tropical and sub-tropical seas. It is known to attain to a
length of 40 feet. The tooth figured here, of the natural size, is
taken from a jaw 20 inches wide in its transverse diameter (inside
measure), each half of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span> mandible measuring 22 inches.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> The whole
length of the fish was 36½ feet.</p>

<p>Carcharodon teeth are of very common occurrence in various tertiary
strata, and have been referred to several species, affording ample
evidence that this type was much more numerously represented in that
geological epoch than in the recent fauna. Some individuals attained to
an immense size, as we may judge from teeth found in the Crag, which
are 4 inches wide at the base, and 5 inches long, measured along their
lateral margin. The naturalists of the “Challenger” expedition have
made the highly interesting discovery that teeth of similar size are
of common occurrence in the ooze of the Pacific, between Polynesia and
the west coast of America. As we have no record of living individuals
of that bulk having been observed, the gigantic species to which these
teeth belonged must have become extinct within a comparatively recent
period. Nothing is known of the anatomy, habits, and reproduction of
the surviving species, and no opportunity should be lost of obtaining
information on this Shark.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Odontaspis.</span>—The second dorsal and anal are not
much smaller than the first dorsal. No pit at the root of

large, awl-shaped, with one or two small cusps at the base.
Gill-openings of moderate width.</p>

<p>Large Sharks from tropical and temperate seas; two species.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Alopecias.</span>—The second dorsal and anal very small.
Caudal fin of extraordinary length, with a pit at its root.
No keel on the side of the tail. Mouth and gill-openings of
moderate width. Teeth equal in both jaws, of moderate size,
flat, triangular, not serrated.</p>
</div>

<p>This genus consists of one species only, which is known by the name of
“Fox-shark” or “Thresher.” It is the most common of the larger kinds
of Sharks which occur on the British coasts; and seems to be equally
common in other parts of the Atlantic and Mediterranean, as well as on
the coasts of California and New Zealand. It attains to a length of
fifteen feet, of which the tail takes more than one half; and is quite
harmless to man. It follows the shoals of Herrings, Pilchards, and
Sprats in their migrations, destroying incredible numbers. When feeding
it uses the long tail in splashing the surface of the water, whilst it
swims in gradually decreasing circles round a shoal of fishes, which
are thus kept crowded together, falling an easy prey to their enemy.
Statements that it has been seen to attack Whales and other large
Cetaceans, rest upon erroneous observations.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Selache.</span>—The second dorsal and anal very small. A pit
at the root of the caudal fin, which is provided with a lower
lobe. Side of the tail with a keel. Gill-openings extremely
wide. Teeth very small, numerous, conical, without serrature or
lateral cusps.</p>
</div>

<p>Also this genus consists of one species only, the “Basking Shark”
(Pélerin of the French). It is the largest Shark of the North Atlantic,
growing to a length of more than thirty feet. It is quite harmless if
not attacked; its food consisting of small fishes, and other small
marine animals swimming in shoals. On the west coast of Ireland it
is chased for the sake of the oil which is extracted from the liver,
one fish yielding from a ton to a ton and a-half. Its capture is not
unattended with danger, as one blow from the enormously strong tail is
sufficient to stave in the sides of a large boat. At certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span> seasons
it is gregarious, and many specimens may be seen in calm weather lying
together motionless, with the upper part of the back raised above the
surface of the water; a habit from which this Shark has derived its
name. The buccal and branchial cavities are of extraordinary width,
and, in consequence of the flabby condition of those parts, the head
presents a variable and singular appearance in specimens lying dead on
the ground. This peculiarity, as well as the circumstance that young
specimens have a much longer and more pointed snout than adult ones,
has led to the erroneous opinion that several different genera and
species of Basking Shark occur in the European seas. The branchial
arches of <i>Selache</i> are provided with a very broad fringe of
long (five to six inches) and thin gill-rakers, possessing the same
microscopical structure as the teeth and dermal productions of Sharks.
Similar gill-rakers have been found in a fossil state in the Crag of
Anvers in Belgium, proving the existence of this Selachian type in the
tertiary epoch. Nothing is known of the reproduction of this fish.
The latest contributions to its history are by <i>Steenstrup</i> in
“Overs. Dansk. Vidensk. Selsk., Forhandl.” 1873, and by <i>Pavesi</i>
in “Annal. Mus. Civ. Geneva,” 1874 and 1878.</p>


<h6 class="smcap">Third Family—Rhinodontidæ.</h6>

<p><i>No nictitating membrane. Anal fin present. Two dorsal fins, the
first nearly opposite to the ventrals, without spine in front. Mouth
and nostril near the extremity of the snout.</i></p>

<p>This small family comprises one species only, <i>Rhinodon typicus</i>,
a gigantic Shark, which is known to exceed a length of fifty feet,
but is stated to attain that of seventy. It does not appear to be
rare in the western parts of the Indian Ocean, and possibly occurs
also in the Pacific. It is one of the most interesting forms, not
unlike the Basking Shark of the Northern Seas, having gill-rakers like
that species;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span> but very little is known of its structure and mode of
life. It is perfectly harmless, its teeth being extremely small and
numerous, placed in broad bands; it has been stated to feed on tang,
an observation which requires confirmation. The snout is very broad,
short, and flat; the eyes are very small. A pit at the root of the
caudal fin which has the lower lobe well developed; side of the tail
with a keel. A characteristic figure of this fish has been given by A.
Smith in his “Illustrations of the Zoology of South Africa,” Plate 26,
from a specimen which came ashore at the Cape of Good Hope.</p>

<h6 class="smcap">Fourth Family—Notidanidæ.</h6>

<p><i>No nictitating membrane. One dorsal fin only, without spine,
opposite to the anal.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Notidanus.</span>—Dentition unequal in the jaws: in the upper
jaw one or two pairs of awl-shaped teeth, the following six
being broader, and provided with several cusps, one of which is
much the strongest. Lower jaw with six large comb-like teeth on
each side, beside the smaller posterior teeth. Spiracles small,
on the side of the neck. No pit at the root of the caudal fin.
Gill-openings wide, six in number in <i>Hexanchus</i>, seven in
<i>Heptanchus</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>Four species are known, distributed over nearly all the tropical and
sub-tropical seas; they attain to a length of about fifteen feet.
Fossil teeth belonging to this type have been found in Jurassic and
later formations (<i>Notidanus</i> and <i>Aellopos</i>).</p>


<h6 class="smcap">Fifth Family—Scylliidæ.</h6>

<p><i>Two dorsal fins, without spine: the first above or behind the
ventrals; anal fin present. No nictitating membrane. Spiracle always
distinct. Mouth inferior. Teeth small, several series generally being
in function.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Scyllium.</span>—The origin of the anal fin is always in
advance of that of the second dorsal. Nasal cavity separate from
the mouth. Teeth small, with a middle longer cusp, and generally
one or two small lateral cusps arranged in numerous series. Eggs
similar to those of the Rays (Fig. <a href="#fig79">79</a>, p. 167).</p>
</div>

<p>The fishes of this genus are of small size, and commonly called
“Dog-fishes.” They are coast fishes, living on the bottom, and feeding
on Crustaceans, dead fishes, etc. None of the eight species known have
a very wide distribution, but where they occur they are generally
sufficiently abundant to prove troublesome to fishermen. They inhabit
most parts of the temperate and tropical seas. On the British coasts
two species are found, the “Larger” and “Lesser spotted Dog-fish,”
<i>Scyllium canicula</i> and <i>Scyllium catulus</i>, which are
said to be more plentiful among the Orkney Islands than elsewhere.
They are scarcely ever brought to market; but the fishermen of some
localities do not disdain to eat them. Their flesh is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span> remarkably
white, a little fibrous, and dry. In the Orkneys they are skinned,
split up, cleaned, and then spread out on the rocks to dry for home
consumption. The skins are used for smoothing down cabinet-work. It
would be worth while to apply the fins of these and other Sharks, which
are so extensively used in China for making gelatine soups, to the same
purpose in this country, or to dry them for exportation to the East.
Most of the species of Dog-fishes are spotted, and those of the allied
genera, <i>Parascyllium</i> and <i>Chiloscyllium</i>, very handsomely
ornamented.</p>

<p>Closely allied to <i>Scyllium</i> is <i>Pristiurus</i>, from the coasts
of Europe, which is provided with a series of small flat spines on each
side of the upper edge of the caudal fin.</p>

<p>Fossil forms of Dog-fishes are not scarce in the Lias and Chalk:
<i>Scylliodus</i>, <i>Palæoscyllium</i>, <i>Thyellina</i>,
<i>Pristiurus</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Ginglymostoma.</span>—The second dorsal fin opposite to, and
somewhat in advance of, the anal. Eyes very small; spiracle
minute and behind the eye. Nasal and buccal cavities confluent.
The nasal valves of both sides form one quadrangular flap in
front of the mouth, each being provided with a free cylindrical
cirrhus. The fourth and fifth gill-openings are close
together. The teeth stand either in many series, each having
a strong median cusp and one or two smaller ones on each side
(<i>Ginglymostoma</i>), or they stand in a few (three) series
only, the foremost only being in function, and each tooth having
a convex, finely and equally serrated margin (<i>Nebrius</i>).</p>
</div>

<p>Four species from the tropical parts of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans,
attaining to a length of some 12 feet. Pelagic.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Stegostoma.</span>—The first dorsal above the ventrals,
the second in advance of the anal, which is very close to the
caudal. Tail, with the caudal fin, exceedingly long, measuring
one-half of the total length. Eyes very small, spiracle as wide
as, and situated behind, the orbit. Nasal and buccal cavities
confluent. Snout very obtuse; upper lip very thick, like a pad,
bent downwards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span> over the mouth, with a free cylindrical cirrhus
on each side. Teeth small, trilobed, in many series, occupying
in both jaws a transverse flat subquadrangular patch. The fourth
and fifth gill-openings are close together.</p>
</div>

<p>The single species (<i>St. tigrinum</i>) for which this genus has been
formed, is one of the commonest and handsomest sharks of the Indian
Ocean. Young individuals keep generally close to the coasts, whilst
the adult, which are from 10 to 15 feet long, are not rarely met in
the open ocean. The colour is a brownish yellow, ornamented with black
or brown transverse bands, or with snuff-coloured rounded spots; hence
this shark is frequently mentioned by the names of “Zebra-Shark” or
“Tiger-Shark.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Crossorhinus.</span>—The first dorsal behind the ventrals,
the second in advance of the anal, which is very close to the
caudal. Tail rather short. Eyes small. Spiracle a wide oblique
slit, behind and below the eye. Nasal and buccal cavities
confluent. Head broad, flat, with the snout very obtuse; mouth
wide, nearly anterior. A free nasal cirrhus; sides of the head
with skinny appendages. Anterior teeth rather large, long and
slender, without lateral lobes, the lateral tricuspid, smaller,
forming a few series only. The fourth and fifth gill-openings
close together.</p>
</div>

<p>Three species are known from the Australian and Japanese coasts. They
are evidently ground-sharks, which lie concealed on the bottom watching
for their prey. In accordance with this habit their colour closely
assimilates that of a rock or stone covered with short vegetable and
coralline growth—a resemblance increased by the frond-like tentacles
on the side of the head. This peculiarity of the integuments, which is
developed in a yet higher degree in Pediculati and Lophobranchs, is not
met with in any other Selachian. These Sharks grow to a length of 10
feet.</p>


<h6 class="smcap">Sixth Family—Hybodontidæ.</h6>

<p><i>Two dorsal fins, each with a serrated spine. Teeth rounded,
longitudinally striated, with one larger, and from two to four smaller
lateral cusps. Skin covered with shagreen.</i></p>

<p>This family is one of particular interest, because representatives of
it occur in numerous modifications in primary and secondary strata.
Their dentition is uniformly adapted for the prehension and mastication
of crustaceous and hard-shelled animals. The fossil forms far
exceeded in size the species of the only surviving genus; they make,
their appearance with <i>Ctenoptychius</i> in the Devonian; this is
succeeded in the coal-measures by <i>Psammodus</i>, <i>Chomatodus</i>,
<i>Petrodus</i>, <i>Coch</i><i>liodus</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span> <i>Polyrhizodus</i>,
etc.; in the Trias and Chalk by <i>Strophodus</i>, <i>Acrodus</i>,
<i>Thectodus</i>, and <i>Ptychodus</i>. Of the 25 genera known, 22 have
lived in the periods preceding the Oolitic.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Cestracion (Heterodontus).</span>—Each dorsal fin armed with

both jaws, viz. small obtuse teeth in front, which in young

<h6 class="smcap">Eighth Family—Spinacidæ.</h6>

<p><i>No membrana nictitans. Two dorsal fins; no anal. Mouth but slightly
arched; a long, deep, straight, oblique groove on each side of the

notched at their origin.</i></p>

<p>The oldest representative of this family (<i>Palæospinax</i>)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span> occurs
at Lyme Regis; its skin is granular; each dorsal fin possesses a spine;
the teeth in the jaws are dissimilar—the upper being multicuspid,
longitudinally ribbed as in Hybodus, the lower smooth and tricuspid.
<i>Drepanophorus</i> and <i>Spinax primævus</i> occur in Cretaceous
formations of England and the Lebanon.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Centrina.</span>—Each dorsal fin with a strong spine. Trunk
rather elevated, trihedral, with a fold of the skin running
along each side of the belly. Teeth of the lower jaw erect,
triangular, finely serrated; those of the upper slender,
conical, forming a group in front of the jaw. Spiracles wide,
behind the eye.</p>
</div>

<p>One species, <i>Centrina salviani</i>, from the Mediterranean and
neighbouring parts of the Atlantic; of small size.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Acanthias.</span>—Each dorsal fin with a spine. Teeth equal
in both jaws, rather small; their point is so much turned aside
that the inner margin of the tooth forms the cutting edge.
Spiracles rather wide, immediately behind the eye.</p>
</div>

<p>The two species of “Spiny Dog-fishes,” <i>A. vulgaris</i> and <i>A.
blainvillii</i>, have a very remarkable distribution, being found in
the temperate seas of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, but not
in the intermediate tropical zone. They are of small size, but occur
at times in incredible numbers, 20,000 having been taken in one scene
on the Cornish coast. They do much injury to the fishermen by cutting
their lines and carrying off their hooks.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Centrophorus.</span>—Each dorsal fin with a spine which,
however, is sometimes so small as to be hidden below the skin.
Mouth wide. Teeth of the lower jaw with the point more or less
inclined backwards and outwards. Upper teeth erect, triangular,
or narrow, lanceolate, with a single cusp. Spiracles wide,
behind the eye.</p>
</div>

<p>Eight species are known from the southern parts of the European seas,
and one from the Moluccas; they do not appear to exceed a length
of five feet. According to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span> observations of E. P. Wright, some
of the species at least live at a considerable depth, perhaps at a
greater depth than any of the other known Sharks. The Portuguese
fishermen fish for them in 400 or 500 fathoms with a line of some 600
fathoms in length. The Sharks caught were specimens of <i>Centrophorus
coelolepis</i>, from three to four feet long. “These sharks, as they
were hauled into the boat, fell down into it like so many dead pigs;
there was not the smallest motion of their bodies. There can be no
reasonable doubt that they were inhabitants of the same great depth as
<i>Hyalonema</i>” and that, in fact, they were killed by being dragged
to the surface from the pressure of water under which they lived.
The dermal productions of some of the species have a very peculiar
form, being leaf-shaped, pedunculate, or ribbed, or provided with an
impression.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Spinax.</span>—Each dorsal fin with a spine. Teeth of the
lower jaw with the point so much turned aside that the inner
margin of the tooth forms the cutting edge. Upper teeth erect,
each with a long-pointed cusp and one or two small ones on each
side. Spiracles wide, superior, behind the eye.</p>
</div>

<p>Three small species from the Atlantic and the southern extremity of
America. <i>Centroscyllium</i> is an allied genus from the coast of
Greenland.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Scymnus.</span>—Two short dorsal fins without spine, the

<p>The “Greenland Shark” is an inhabitant of the Arctic regions, but
rarely straying to the latitudes of great Britain; it grows to a length
of about 15 feet, and, although it never or but rarely attacks man, is
one of the greatest enemies of the whale, which is often found with
large pieces bitten out of the tail by this Shark. Its voracity is so
great that, according to Scoresby, it is absolutely fearless of the
presence of man whilst engaged in feeding on the carcass of a whale,
so that it can be pierced through with a spear or knife without being
driven away. It is stated to be viviparous, and to produce about four
young at a birth.</p>

  </div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Echinorhinus.</span>—Two very small dorsal fins, without
spine,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span> the first opposite to the ventrals. Skin with scattered
large round tubercles. Nostrils midway between the mouth and the
end of the snout. Teeth equal in both jaws, very oblique, the
point being turned outwards; several strong denticulations on
each side of the principal point. Spiracles small.</p>
</div>

<p>The “Spinous Shark” is readily recognised by the short bulky form of
its body, short tail, and large spinous tubercles. It is evidently a
ground-shark, which probably lives at some depth and but accidentally
comes to the surface. More frequently met with in the Mediterranean, it
has been found several times on the south coast of England, and near
the Cape of Good Hope.</p>

<p><i>Euprotomicrus</i> and <i>Isistius</i> are two other genera of this
family; they are pelagic and but little known.</p>


<h6 class="smcap">Ninth Family—Rhinidæ.</h6>

<p><i>No anal fin; two dorsal fins. Spiracles present. Pectoral fins
large, with the basal portion prolonged forwards, but not grown to the
head.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Rhina.</span>—Head and body depressed, flat; mouth anterior.
Gill-openings rather wide, lateral, partly covered by the base
of the pectoral. Spiracles wide, behind the eyes. Teeth conical,
pointed, distant. Dorsal fins on the tail.</p>
</div>

<p>The “Angel-fish,” or “Monk-fish” (<i>Rh. squatina</i>), approaches
the Rays as regards general form and habits. Within the temperate and
tropical zones it is almost cosmopolitan, being well known on the
coasts of Europe, eastern North America, California, Japan, South
Australia, etc.; it does not seem to exceed a length of five feet; it
is viviparous, producing about twenty young at a birth.</p>

<p>Extinct forms, closely allied to the “Angel-fish,” are found in the
Oolite, and have been described as <i>Thaumas</i>. The carboniferous
genus, <i>Orthacanthus</i>, may have been allied to this family, but it
was armed with a spine immediately behind the head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span></p>


<h6 class="smcap">Tenth Family—Pristiophoridæ.</h6>

<p><i>The rostral cartilage is produced, into an exceedingly long, flat
lamina, armed along each edge with a series of teeth</i> (saw).</p>

<p>These Sharks resemble so much the common Saw-fishes as to be easily
confounded with them, but their gill-openings are lateral, and not
inferior. They are also much smaller in size, and a pair of long
tentacles are inserted at the lower side of the saw. The four species
known (<i>Pristiophorus</i>) occur in the Australian and Japanese seas.</p>

<p><i>Squaloraja</i>, from the Lias, is supposed to have its nearest
affinities to this family.</p>


<h6>B. <span class="smcap">Batoidei—Rays.</span></h6>

<p>In the typical Rays the body is excessively depressed, and forms,
with the expanded pectoral fins, a circular or sub-rhomboidal disk,
of which the slender tail appears as a more or less long appendage.
In the two families which we shall place first (<i>Pristidæ</i> and
<i>Rhinobatidæ</i>), the general habit of the body still resembles that
of the Sharks, but the gill-openings are ventral, as in the true Rays;
the anal fin is invariably absent, and the dorsal fins, if developed,
are placed on the tail. The mode of life of those fishes is quite in
accordance with the form of their body. Whilst the species with a
shark-like body and muscular tail swim freely through the water, and
are capable of executing rapid and sustained motions, the true Rays
lead a sedentary life, moving slowly on the bottom, rarely ascending
to the surface. Their tail has almost entirely lost the function of an
organ of locomotion, acting in some merely as a rudder. They progress
solely by means of the pectoral fins, the broad and thin margins of
which are set in an undulating motion, entirely identical with that
of the dorsal and anal fins of the <i>Pleuronectidæ</i>. They are
exclusively carnivorous, like the Sharks, but unable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span> to pursue and
catch rapidly-moving animals; therefore they feed chiefly on molluscous
and crustaceous animals. However, the colour of their integuments
assimilates so closely that of their surroundings, that other fishes
approach them near enough to be captured by them. The mouth of Rays
being entirely at the lower surface of the head, the prey is not
directly seized with the jaws; but the fish darts over its victim so as
to cover and hold it down with its body, when it is conveyed by some
rapid motions to the mouth.</p>

<p>Rays do not descend to the same depth as Sharks; with one
exception,<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> at least, none have been known to have been caught by a
dredge worked in more than 100 fathoms. The majority are coast fishes,
and have a comparatively limited geographical range, none extending
from the northern temperate zone into the southern. However, some, if
not all the species of the family <i>Myliobatidæ</i>, which includes
the giants of this division of Plagiostomes, have a claim of being
included among the Pelagic fishes, as they are frequently met with
in the open ocean at a great distance from the shore. It is probable
that the occurrence of such individuals in the open sea indicates the
neighbourhood of some bank or other comparatively shallow locality.
Many species are exclusively confined to fresh water, and occur far
inland, especially in tropical America.</p>

<p>The majority are oviparous. All have five pairs of gill-openings. The
number of known species is about the same as that of Sharks, viz. 140.</p>


<h6 class="smcap">First Family—Pristidæ.</h6>

<p><i>The snout is produced into an exceedingly long flat lamina, armed
with a series of strong teeth along each edge</i> (saw).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Pristis.</span>—Body depressed and elongate, gradually
passing into the strong and muscular tail. Pectoral fins, with
the front margins quite free, not extending to the head. No
tentacles below the saw. Teeth in the jaws minute, obtuse.
Dorsal fins without spine, the first opposite or close to the
base of the ventrals.</p>
</div>

<p>“Saw-fishes.” Abundant in tropical, less so in sub-tropical seas. They
attain to a considerable size, specimens with a saw 6 feet long and 1
foot broad at the base not being of uncommon occurrence. The saw, which
is their weapon of attack, renders them most dangerous to almost all
the other large inhabitants of the ocean. Its endoskeleton consists
of three, sometimes five, rarely four, hollow cylindrical tubes,
placed side by side, tapering towards the end, and incrusted with an
osseous deposit. These tubes are the rostral processes of the cranial
cartilage, and exist in all Rays, though in them they are shorter and
much less developed. The teeth of the saw are implanted in deep sockets
of the hardened integument. The teeth proper, with which the jaws
are armed, are much too small for inflicting wounds or seizing other
animals. Saw-fishes use this weapon in tearing pieces of flesh off
an animal’s body or ripping open its abdomen. The detached fragments
or protruding soft parts are then seized by them and swallowed. Five
distinct species of Saw-fishes are known.</p>

<p>Saws of extinct species have been found in the London clay of Sheppey
and in the Bagshot sands.</p>


<h6 class="smcap">Second Family—Rhinobatidæ.</h6>

<p><i>Tail strong and long, with two well-developed dorsal fins, and a
longitudinal fold on each side; caudal developed. Disk not excessively
dilated, the rayed portion of the pectoral fins not being continued to
the snout.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Rhynchobatus.</span>—Dorsal fins without spine, the first
opposite to the ventrals. Caudal fin with the lower lobe well
developed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span> Teeth obtuse, granular, the dental surfaces of the
jaws being undulated.</p>
</div>

  </div>

<p>Two species, <i>Rh. ancylostomus</i> and <i>Rh. djeddensis</i>, are
very common on the tropical coasts of the Indian Ocean. They feed on
hard-shelled animals, and attain scarcely a length of 8 feet.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Rhinobatus.</span>—Cranial cartilage produced into a long
rostral process, the space between the process and pectoral fin
being filled by a membrane. Teeth obtuse, with an indistinct
transverse ridge. Dorsal fins without spine, both at a great
distance behind the ventral fins. Caudal fin without lower lobe.</p>
</div>

<p>Numerous on the coasts of tropical and sub-tropical seas; about twelve
species. <i>Trygonorhina</i> is an allied genus from South Australia.</p>

<p>The oolitic genus <i>Spathobatis</i> is scarcely distinct from
<i>Rhinobatus</i>; and another fossil from Mount Lebanon has been
actually referred to this latter genus. <i>Trigorhina</i> from Monte
Postale must be placed here.</p>


<h6 class="smcap">Third Family—Torpedinidæ.</h6>

<p><i>The trunk is a broad, smooth disk. Tail with a longitudinal fold
on each side; a rayed dorsal fin is generally, and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span> caudal always,
present. Anterior nasal valves confluent into a quadrangular lobe.
An electric organ composed of vertical hexagonal prisms between the
pectoral fins and the head.</i></p>

<p>“Electric Rays.” The electric organs with which these fishes are armed
are large, flat, uniform bodies, lying one on each side of the head,
bounded behind by the scapular arch, and laterally by the anterior
crescentic tips of the pectoral fins. They consist of an assemblage
of vertical hexagonal prisms, whose ends are in contact with the
integuments above and below; and each prism is subdivided by delicate
transverse septa, forming cells, filled with a clear, trembling,
jelly-like fluid, and lined within by an epithelium of nucleated
corpuscles. Between this epithelium and the transverse septa and walls
of the prism there is a layer of tissue on which the terminations
of the nerves and vessels ramify. Hunter counted 470 prisms in each
battery of <i>Torpedo marmorata</i>, and demonstrated the enormous
supply of nervous matter which they receive. Each organ receives one
branch of the Trigeminal nerve and four branches of the Vagus, the
former, and the three anterior branches of the latter, being each as
thick as the spinal chord (electric lobes). The fish gives the electric
shock voluntarily, when it is excited to do so in self-defence or
intends to stun or to kill its prey; but to receive the shock the
object must complete the galvanic circuit by communicating with the
fish at two distinct points, either directly or through the medium
of some conducting body. If an insulated frog’s leg touches the fish
by the end of the nerve only, no muscular contractions ensue on the
discharge of the battery, but a second point of contact immediately
produces them. It is said that a painful sensation may be produced
by a discharge conveyed through the medium of a stream of water. The
electric currents created in these fishes exercise all the other known
powers of electricity: they render the needle magnetic, decompose
chemical compounds,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span> and emit the spark. The dorsal surface of the
electric organ is positive, the ventral surface negative.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[The literature on the electric organ of Torpedo is very
extensive. Here may be mentioned <i>Lorenzini</i>, “Osservazioni
intorno alle Torpedini,” (1678); <i>Walsh</i>, “On the
Electric Property of the Torpedo,” in Philos. Trans., 1773;
<i>Hunter</i>, “Anatomical Observations on the Torpedo,”
<i>ibid.</i>; <i>Davy</i>, “Observations on the Torpedo,” in
Philos. Trans., 1834; <i>Matteucci</i> and <i>Savi</i>, “Traité
des Phénomènes Electro-Physiologiques,” 1844.]</p>
</div>

<p>Of the genus <i>Torpedo</i> six species are known, distributed over
the Atlantic and Indian Oceans; three of them are rather common in
the Mediterranean, and one (<i>T. hebetans</i>) reaches the south
coast of England. They attain to a width of from two to three feet,
and specimens of that size are able to disable by a single discharge
a full-grown man, and, therefore, may prove dangerous to bathing
persons. Other genera, differing from <i>Torpedo</i> in the position
and structure of some of the fins, are found in other tropical and
sub-tropical seas, viz. <i>Narcine</i>, <i>Hypnos</i>, <i>Discopyge</i>
(Peru), <i>Astrape</i>, and <i>Temera</i>. All, like electric fishes
generally, have a naked body.</p>

<p>A large fish, of the general appearance of a Torpedo, has been found at
Monte Bolca; and <i>Cyclobatis</i>, from the upper cretaceous limestone
of Lebanon, is probably another extinct representative of this family.</p>


<h6 class="smcap">Fourth Family—Rajidæ.</h6>

<p><i>Disk broad, rhombic, generally with asperities or spines; tail with
a longitudinal fold on each side. The pectoral fins extend to the
snout. No electric organ; no serrated caudal spine.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Raja.</span>—Two dorsal fins on the tail, without spine; tail
with a rudimentary caudal fin, or without caudal. Each ventral
fin divided into two by a deep notch. Teeth small, obtuse, or
pointed. Pectoral fins not extending forwards to the extremity
of the snout. Nasal valves separated in the middle, where they
are without a free margin (see Fig. <a href="#fig1">1</a>, p. 34).</p>

clavata.</p>
  </div>

<p>Of all the genera of <i>Batoidei</i>, Rays have the widest geographical
range; they are chiefly inhabitants of temperate seas, and much more
numerous in those of the Northern than of the Southern Hemisphere.
They advance more closely to the Arctic and Antarctic circles than
any other member of this group. More than thirty species are known,
of which the following are found on the British coast:—The Thornback
(<i>R. clavata</i>), the Homelyn Ray (<i>R. maculata</i>), the Starry
Ray (<i>R. radiata</i>), the Sandy Ray (<i>R. circularis</i>), the
common Skate (<i>R. batis</i>), the Burton Skate (<i>R. marginata</i>),
and the Shagreen Skate (<i>R. fullonica</i>). Some of these species,
especially the Skates, attain a considerable size, the disk measuring
six and even seven feet across. All are eatable, and some of them
regularly brought to market. In the majority of the species peculiar
sexual differences have been observed. In some, as in the Thornback,
all or some of the teeth are pointed in the male sex, whilst they are
obtuse and flat in the female. The males of all are armed with patches
of claw-like spines, retractile in grooves of the integument, and
serially arranged occupying a space on the upper side of the pectoral
fin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span> near the angle of the disk, and frequently also the sides of the
head. In species which are armed with bucklers or asperities it is the
female which is principally provided with these dermal productions, the
male being entirely or nearly smooth. Also the colour is frequently
different in the two sexes.</p>

<p>Other genera of this family are <i>Psammobatis</i>, <i>Sympterygia</i>,
and <i>Platyrhina</i>. Although probably this family was well
represented in cretaceous and tertiary formations, the remains found
hitherto are comparatively few. <i>Arthropterus</i>, from the Lias,
seems to have been a true Ray; and dermal spines of a species allied to
the Thornback (<i>Raja antiqua</i>) are abundant in the crag deposits
of Suffolk and Norfolk.</p>


<h6 class="smcap">Fifth Family—Trygonidæ.</h6>

<p><i>The pectoral fins are uninterruptedly continued to, and confluent
at, the extremity of the snout. Tail long and slender, without lateral
longitudinal folds; vertical fins none, or imperfectly developed, often
replaced by a strong serrated spine.</i></p>

<p>The “Sting-Rays” are as numerous as the Rays proper, but they inhabit
rather tropical than temperate seas. The species armed with a spine
use it as a weapon of defence, and the wounds inflicted by it are, to
man, extremely painful, and have frequently occasioned the loss of a
limb. We have mentioned above (p. <a href="#Page_190">190</a>) that the danger arises from the
lacerated nature of the wound as well as from the poisonous property of
the mucus inoculated. The spines (Fig. <a href="#fig98">98</a>, p. 190) are always barbed on
the sides, and may be eight or nine inches long in the larger species.
They are shed from time to time, and replaced by others growing behind
the one in function, as the teeth of the fishes of this order, or as
the fangs of a poisonous snake. Fossil species of <i>Trygon</i> and
<i>Urolophus</i> occur in the tertiary strata of Monte Bolca and Monte
Postale. The genera into which the various species have been divided
are the following:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Urogymnus.</span>—Tail long, without fin or spine, sometimes
with a narrow cutaneous fold below. Body densely covered with
osseous tubercles. Teeth flattened.</p>
</div>

<p>Only one species is known (<i>U. asperrimus</i>), common in the Indian
Ocean, and with a body from 4 to 5 feet long; the skin is frequently
used for covering shields and the handles of swords and other weapons,
its rough surface offering a firm hold to the hand.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Trygon.</span>—Tail very long, tapering, armed with a long
arrow-shaped barbed spine. Body smooth or with tubercles. Nasal
valves coalescent into a quadrangular flap. Teeth flattened.</p>
</div>

<p>Some twenty-five species are known, one of which (<i>T. pastinaca</i>)
extends from the south coast of England and the east coast of North
America through the Atlantic and Indian Ocean to Japan. The majority
of the species belong to the tropical parts of the Indian and Atlantic
Oceans; some inhabit exclusively freshwaters of eastern tropical
America. A closely allied genus is <i>Tæniura</i>, with six species.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Urolophus.</span>—Tail of moderate length, with a distinct
rayed terminal fin, armed with a barbed spine, without or with a
rudimentary dorsal fin. Teeth flattened.</p>
</div>

<p>Seven species from tropical seas, apparently of small size.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Pteroplatea.</span>—Body at least twice as broad as long;
tail very short and thin, without or with a rudimentary fin, and
with a serrated spine. Teeth very small, uni- or tri-cuspid.</p>
</div>

<p>Six species from temperate and tropical seas.</p>


<h6 class="smcap">Sixth Family—Myliobatidæ.</h6>

<p><i>The disk is very broad, in consequence of the great development of
the pectoral fins, which, however, leave the sides of the head free,
and reappear at the extremity of the snout as a pair of detached
(cephalic) fins. Viviparous.</i></p>

<p>“Devil-fishes,” “Sea-devils,” or “Eagle-rays.” Generally of large
size, inhabiting temperate and tropical seas. Some genera possess a
pair of singular cephalic processes, which generally project in a
direction parallel to the longitudinal axis of the body, but are said
to be flexible in the living fish, and used for scooping food from the
bottom and conveying it to the mouth. In all the species the dentition
consists of perfectly flat molars, forming a kind of mosaic pavement in
both the upper and lower jaws: a most perfect mechanical arrangement
for crushing alimentary substances.</p>

narrower series on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span> each side. Tail very long and thin, with a
dorsal fin near its root; generally a serrated spine behind the
fin.</p>
</div>

<p>Seven species are known, two of which are European, one (<i>M.
aquila</i>) being almost cosmopolitan, and occasionally found on the
British coast. The young differ much from the adult, having no median
series of larger teeth, but all the teeth of equal size and regularly
sexangular. Also the tail is much longer in young examples than in old
ones, and the coloration more ornamental. Teeth of species very closely
allied to, or perhaps even identical with, existing species, are found
in tertiary formations.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Aëtobatis.</span>—Form of the head, body, and tail as
<i>Myliobatis</i>. The nasal valves remain separate, each
forming a long flap. The lower dental lamina projects beyond the
upper. Teeth flat, broad, forming a single series, equivalent
to the median series of <i>Myliobatis</i>, there being no small
lateral teeth.</p>

tropical seas, and of exceedingly common occurrence in the Atlantic and
Indian Oceans; it does not seem to grow to a very large size (perhaps

round bluish-white spots, with which the back is ornamented. Fossils of

dentition is very peculiar, no opportunity should be lost of obtaining
and preserving entire animals. Teeth very similar to those of existing
species, and described as <i>Zygobatis</i>, occur<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span> in the Norwich Crag

<p>The species of these two last genera are not yet well distinguished;
about five of <i>Dicerobatis</i> and two of <i>Ceratoptera</i> are
known from tropical and temperate seas, but their occurrence in the
latter is rather sporadic. Some of them, if not all, attain an enormous
size. One mentioned by Risso, taken off Messina, weighed 1250 pounds.
Several observers speak of having seen them in pairs, the male being
usually the smaller. Of a pair mentioned by Risso the female was first
taken, and the male remained hovering about the boat for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span> three days,
and was afterwards found floating dead on the surface. Still larger
individuals, but of uncertain species, are mentioned by Lacépède, who
says that one taken at Barbadoes required seven yoke of oxen to draw
it. A sketch of another, which was said to be twenty feet long, was
sent to Lacépède; and Sonnini speaks of one which appeared to him to be
longer and wider than the ship in which he was sailing. A fœtus taken
from the uterus of the mother captured at Jamaica, and preserved in
the British Museum, is five feet broad, and weighed twenty pounds. The
mother measured fifteen feet in width as well as in length, and was
between three and four feet thick. The capture of “Devil-fishes” of
such large size is attended with danger, as they not rarely attack and
capsize the boat. They are said to be especially dangerous when they
accompany their young, of which they bring forth one only at a time.</p>


<h5 class="smaller">SECOND SUB-ORDER—HOLOCEPHALA.</h5>

<p><i>One external gill-opening only, covered by a fold of the skin, which
encloses a rudimentary cartilaginous gill-cover; four branchial clefts
within the gill-cavity. The maxillary and palatal apparatus coalescent
with the skull.</i></p>

<p>This suborder is represented in the living fauna by one family only,
<i>Chimæridæ</i>; it forms a passage to the following order of fishes,
the Ganoids. In external appearance, and with regard to the structure
of their organs of propagation, the Chimæras are Sharks (See Fig. <a href="#fig96">96</a>,
p. 184). The males are provided with “claspers” in connection with
the ventral fins, and the ova are large, encased in a horny capsule,
and few in number; and there is no doubt that they are impregnated
within the oviduct, as in Sharks. Chimæras are naked, but, as in
<i>Scylliidæ</i>, very young individuals possess a series of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span> small
“placoid” spines, which occupy the median line of the back, and remind
us of similar dermal productions in the Rays. The males, besides, are
provided with a singular erectile appendage, spiny at its extremity,
and received in a groove on the top of the head. On the other hand, the
relations of the Chimæras to the Ganoid, and, more especially, Dipnoous
type become manifest in their notochordal skeleton and continuity
of cranial cartilage. The spine in front of the first dorsal fin is
articulated to the neural apophysis, and not merely implanted in the
soft parts, and immovable as in Sharks. A cartilaginous operculum
makes its appearance, and the external gill-opening is single. The
dentition is that of a Dipnoid, each “jaw” being armed with a pair of
broad dental plates, with the addition of a pair of smaller cutting
teeth in the upper “jaw.” Fossils of similar dental combination are
not rare in strata, commencing from the Lias and the bottom of the
Oolitic series; but it is impossible to decide in every case whether
the fossil should be referred to the Holocephalous or Dipnoous type.
According to Newberry, Chimæroid fishes commence in the Devonian with
<i>Rhynchodus</i>, the remains of which were discovered by him in
Devonian rocks of Ohio. Undoubted Chimæroids are <i>Elasmodus</i>,
<i>Psaliodus</i>, <i>Ganodus</i>, <i>Ischyodus</i>, <i>Edaphodon</i>,
and <i>Elasmognathus</i>, principally from mesozoic and tertiary
formations. Very similar fossils occur in the corresponding strata
of North America. A single species of <i>Callorhynchus</i> has been
discovered by H. Hector in the Lower Greensand of New Zealand.</p>

<p>The living Chimæras are few in number, and remain within very moderate
dimensions, probably not exceeding a length of five feet, inclusive
of their long filamentous, diphycercal tail. They are referred to two
genera.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Chimæra.</span>—Snout soft, prominent, without appendage. The
dorsal fins occupying the greater part of the back, anterior
with a very strong and long spine. Longitudinal axis of the
tail nearly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span> the same as that of the trunk, its extremity being
provided with a low fin above and below, similar in form to a
dorsal and anal fin. Anal fin very low.</p>
</div>

<p>Three species are known: <i>Ch. monstrosa</i>, from the coasts of
Europe and Japan and the Cape of Good Hope; <i>Ch. colliei</i> from the
west coast of North America; and <i>Ch. affinis</i> from the coast of
Portugal. (See Fig. <a href="#fig96">96</a>, p. 184.)</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Callorhynchus.</span>—Snout with a cartilaginous prominence,
terminating in a cutaneous flap. Two dorsal fins, the anterior
with a very strong and long spine. Extremity of the tail
distinctly turned upwards, with a fin along its lower edge, but
without one above. Anal fin close to the caudal, short and deep.</p>
</div>

<p>One species (<i>C. antarcticus</i>) is common in the Southern temperate
zone. Cunningham describes the egg (see Fig. <a href="#fig81">81</a>, p. 169), as being of
a dark greenish-black colour, and, in general, measuring from eight
to nine or even ten inches in length, by about three in breadth. It
consists of a central, somewhat spindle-shaped convex area (between
the horny walls of which the young fish lies), surrounded by a broad
plicated margin, which is fringed at the edge, and covered on the under
surface with fine light brownish-yellow hairs.</p>


<h4 class="smaller">SECOND ORDER—GANOIDEI.</h4>

<p><i>Skeleton cartilaginous or ossified. Body with medial and paired
fins, the hinder pair abdominal. Gills free, rarely partially attached
to the walls of the gill-cavity. One external gill-opening only on
each side; a gill-cover. Air-bladder with a pneumatic duct. Ova small,
impregnated after exclusion. Embryo sometimes with external gills.</i></p>

<p>To this order belong the majority of the fossil fish remains of
palæozoic and mesozoic age, whilst it is very scantily represented
in the recent fauna, and evidently verging towards total extinction.
The knowledge of the fossil forms, based on mere fragments of the
hard parts of the body only,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span> is very incomplete, and therefore their
classification is in a most unsatisfactory state. In the following
pages only the most important groups will be mentioned.</p>

</div>

<p>Eight suborders may be distinguished at present.</p>


<h5 class="smaller">FIRST SUB-ORDER—PLACODERMI.</h5>

<p><i>Extinct. The head and pectoral region of the body encased in great
bony, sculptured plates, with dots of enamel; the remainder of the body
naked, or with ganoid scales; skeleton notochordal.</i></p>

<p>Comprises the oldest vertebrate remains, from Devonian and
Carboniferous formations. <i>Pterichthys</i>: (Figs. <a href="#fig135">135</a> and <a href="#fig136">136</a>),
tail tapering, covered with small ganoid scales, without caudal fin;
the cephalic shield was probably moveably joined to the cuirass of the
trunk, and both were composed of several pieces; the abdominal shield
consisted of one single median plate, and two pairs of lateral plates,
a third small pair being sometimes observed detached in front of the
anterior pair; pectoral exceedingly long, consisting of two pieces
movably connected with each other; tail scaly, and short; a small
dorsal fin placed on the tail; a pair of small ventrals; jaws small,
with confluent denticles. Several species have been distinguished
in remains found in the strata of Caithness and other localities in
Scotland. <i>Coccosteus</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig137">137</a>, p. 354): all the bony plates are
firmly united, no pectoral spines; tail naked and long; a dorsal and
anal fin supported by interneural and interhæmal spines. Dentition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span>
unknown. <i>Dinichthys</i>: a gigantic fish from the Devonian of North
America (estimated at from 15 to 18 feet in length), with the dermal
covering very similar to that of Coccosteus,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span> but with a simple arched
dorsal shield. As in this latter genus the caudal extremity does not
possess external or internal bony parts, and the ventral plastron
of both genera corresponds in every particular; the dentition is so
singularly like that of Lepidosiren, that Newberry (Geolog. Survey of
Ohio, vol. ii. part 2) considers this genus to be in genetic relation
to the Dipnoi. The following genera have been united in a separate
family, <i>Cephalaspidæ</i>; viz. <i>Cephal</i><i>aspis</i>:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[354]</span> head
covered by a continuous shield with tubercular surface, produced into
a horn at each posterior corner; a median dorsal backward prolongation
bears a spine; heterocercal. <i>Auchenaspis</i> and <i>Didymaspis</i>:
allied to the preceding, but with the cephalic shield divided into a
larger anterior and smaller posterior piece. <i>Pteraspis</i>: with
the cephalic shield finely striated or grooved, composed of seven
pieces. <i>Scaphaspis</i> and <i>Cyathaspis</i>: with the surface
of the head-shield similarly sculptured as in <i>Pteraspis</i>, but
simple in the former, and composed of four pieces in the latter.
<i>Astrolepis</i>: attained to the gigantic size of between twenty and
thirty feet; its mouth was furnished with two rows of teeth, of which
the outer ones were small, the inner much larger.</p>

<h5 class="smaller">SECOND SUB-ORDER—ACANTHODINI.</h5>

<p>Extinct. <i>Body oblong, compressed, covered with shagreen; skull
not ossified; caudal heterocercal. Large spines, similar to those of
Chondropterygians, in front of some of the median and paired fins.
The spines are imbedded between the muscles, and not provided with a
proximal joint.</i></p>

<p><i>Acanthodes</i>, <i>Chiracanthus</i>, from Devonian and Carboniferous
formations.</p>


<h5 class="smaller">THIRD SUB-ORDER—DIPNOI.</h5>

<p><i>Nostrils two pairs, more or less within the mouth; limbs with
an axial skeleton. Lungs and gills. Skeleton notochordal. No
branchiostegals.</i><a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>


<h6 class="smcap">First Family—Sirenidæ.</h6>

<p><i>Caudal fin diphycercal; no gular plates; scales cycloid. A pair of
molars, above and below, and one pair of vomerine teeth.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Lepidosiren.</span>—Body eel-shaped, with one continuous
vertical fin. Limbs reduced to cylindrical filaments, without
fringe. Vomerine teeth conical, pointed. Each dental lamina
or molar with strong cusps, supported by vertical ridges. No
external branchial appendages; five branchial arches, with four
intervening clefts. Conus arteriosus with two longitudinal
valves. Ovaries closed sacs.</p>
</div>

<p>One species only is known from the system of the River Amazons (<i>L.
paradoxa</i>). It must be very locally distributed, as but a few
specimens have been brought to Europe, and all recent endeavours to
obtain others have been unsuccessful. Natterer, by whom this most
interesting fish was discovered, states that he obtained two specimens,
one on the Madeira River, near Borba; the other in a backwater of the
Amazons, above Villa Nova. The natives of the former place called it
Carámurú, and considered it very scarce. The larger individual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span> was
nearly four feet long. It is said to produce a sound not unlike that
of a cat, and to feed on the roots of mandioca and other vegetables.
But, to judge from the dentition, this fish is much more likely to be
carnivorous, like the following. It is one of the greatest desiderata
of Natural History Collections.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[Natterer, “Annalen des Wiener Museum’s,” 1839, ii.; Bischoff.
“Annales des Sciences Naturelles,” 1840. xiv.]</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Protopterus.</span>—Very similar in the general form of
the body and dentition to <i>Lepidosiren</i>. Pectoral and
ventral filaments with a fringe containing rays. Three small
branchial appendages above the small gill-opening; six branchial
arches, with five intervening clefts. Conus arteriosus with two
longitudinal valves. Ovaries closed sacs.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Protopterus annectens</i> is the “Lepidosiren” which is commonly
found in Zoological collections. It is usually imported from the west
coast of Africa, where it abounds in many localities; but it is spread
over the whole of tropical Africa, and forms in many districts of the
central parts a regular article of food.</p>

  </div>

<p>During the dry season, specimens living in shallow waters which
periodically dry up, form a cavity in the mud, the inside of which they
line with a protecting capsule of mucus, and from which they emerge
again when the rains refill the pools inhabited by them. Whilst they
remain in this torpid state of existence, the clay-balls containing
them are frequently dug out, and if the capsules are not broken, the
fishes imbedded in them can be transported to Europe,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[357]</span> and released
by being immersed in slightly tepid water. <i>Protopterus</i> is
exclusively carnivorous, feeding on water-insects, frogs, and fishes,
and attains a length of six feet.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Ceratodus.</span>—Body elongate, compressed, with one
continuous vertical fin. Limbs paddle-shaped, with broad, rayed
fringe. Vomerine teeth incisor-like; molars with flat, undulated
surface, and lateral prongs. No external branchial appendages.
Conus arteriosus with transverse series of valves. Ovaries
transversely lamellated.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

     <p class="p0 center smaller">Fig. 139.—<i>Ceratodus miolepis.</i></p>
  </div>

<p>Two species, <i>C. forsteri</i> and <i>C. miolepis</i>, are known
from fresh waters of Queensland. The specimens hitherto obtained have
come from the Burnett, Dawson, and Mary rivers, some from the fresh
waters of the upper parts, others from the lower brackish portions. The
fish is said to attain to a weight of twenty pounds and to a length
of 6 feet. Locally, the settlers call it “Flat-head,” “Burnett- or
Dawson-Salmon,” and the aborigines “Barramunda,” a name which they
appear to apply also to other large-scaled freshwater fishes, as the
Osteoglossum leichardti. In the stomach there is generally found an
enormous quantity of the leaves of plants growing on the banks of
rivers, evidently eaten after they had fallen into the water and when
in a decomposing condition. The flesh of the fish is salmon-coloured,
and much esteemed as food.</p>

<p>The Barramunda is said to be in the habit of going on land, or at least
on mud-flats; and this assertion appears to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span> be borne out by the fact
that it is provided with a lung. However, it is much more probable
that it rises now and then to the surface of the water in order to
fill its lung with air, and then descends again until the air is so
much deoxygenised as to render a renewal of it necessary. It is also
said to make a grunting noise, which may be heard at night for some
distance. This noise is probably produced by the passage of the air
through the œsophagus when it is expelled for the purpose of renewal.
As the Barramunda has perfectly developed gills, beside the lung, we
can hardly doubt that, when it is in water of normal composition,
and sufficiently pure to yield the necessary supply of oxygen, these
organs are sufficient for the purpose of breathing, and that the
respiratory function rests with them alone. But when the fish is
compelled to sojourn in thick muddy water charged with gases, which are
the products of decomposing organic matter (and this must be the case
very frequently during the droughts which annually exhaust the creeks
of tropical Australia), it commences to breathe air with its lung in
the way indicated above. If the medium in which it happens to be is
perfectly unfit for breathing the gills cease to have any function;
if only in a less degree the gills may still continue to assist in
respiration. The Barramunda, in fact, can breathe by either gills or
lungs alone, or by both simultaneously. It is not probable that it
lives freely out of the water, its limbs being much too flexible for
supporting the heavy and unwieldy body, and too feeble generally to be
of much use in locomotion on land. However, it is quite possible that
it is occasionally compelled to leave the water, although we cannot
believe that it can exist without it in a lively condition for any
length of time.</p>

<p>Of its propagation or development we know nothing, except that it
deposits a great number of eggs of the size of those of a newt, and
enveloped in a gelatinous case. We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[359]</span> may infer that the young are
provided with external gills, as in Protopterus and Polypterus.</p>

<p>The discovery of <i>Ceratodus</i> does not date farther back than
the year 1870, and proved to be of the greatest interest, not only
on account of the relation of this creature to the other living
<i>Dipnoi</i> and <i>Ganoidei</i>, but also because it threw fresh
light on those singular fossil teeth which are found in strata of
Triassic and Jurassic formations in various parts of Europe, India, and
America. These teeth, of which there is a great variety with regard to
general shape and size, are sometimes two inches long, much longer than
broad, depressed, with a flat or slightly undulated, always punctated
crown, with one margin convex, and with from three to seven prongs
projecting on the opposite margin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[361]</span></p>

<p>Sturgeons are, perhaps, the geologically youngest Ganoids, evidence
of their existence not having been met with hitherto in formations
of older date than the Eocene clay of Sheppey. They are exclusively
inhabitants of the temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere, being
either entirely confined to fresh water, or passing, for the purpose of
spawning, a part of the year in rivers. They grow to a large size, and
are the largest fishes of the fresh waters of the Northern Hemisphere,
specimens 10 feet long being of common occurrence. The ova are very
small, and so numerous that one female has been calculated to produce
about three millions at one season; therefore their propagation, as
well as their growth, must be very rapid; and although in many rivers
their number is annually considerably thinned by the systematic manner
in which they are caught when they ascend the rivers in shoals from the
sea, no diminution has been observed. Wherever they occur they prove
to be most valuable on account of their wholesome flesh. In Russia,
besides, two not unimportant articles of trade are obtained from them,
viz. Caviare, which is prepared from their ovaries, and Isinglass,
which is made from the inner coats of their air-bladder. True Sturgeons
are divided into two genera, <i>Acipenser</i> and <i>Scaphirhynchus</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Acipenser.</span>—The rows of osseous bucklers are not
confluent on the tail. Spiracles present. Caudal rays
surrounding the extremity of the tail.</p>
</div>

<p>About twenty different species of Sturgeons may be distinguished
from European, Asiatic, and American rivers. The best known are the
Sterlet (<i>A. ruthenus</i>) from Russian rivers, celebrated for the
excellency of its flesh, but rarely exceeding a length of three feet;
the Californian Short-snouted Sturgeon (<i>A. brachyrhynchus</i>);
the Hausen (<i>A. huso</i>), from rivers, falling into the Black Sea
and the Sea of Azow (rare in Mediterranean), sometimes 12 feet long,
and yielding an inferior kind of isinglass; the Chinese Sturgeon
(<i>A. sinensis</i>);<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[362]</span> the Common Sturgeon of the United States (<i>A.
maculosus</i>), which sometimes crosses the Atlantic to the coasts of
Great Britain; Güldenstædt’s Sturgeon (<i>A. güldenstædtii</i>), common
in European and Asiatic rivers, which yields more than one-fourth of
the caviare and isinglass exported from Russia; the Common Sturgeon
of Western Europe (<i>A. sturio</i>), which attains to a length of 18
feet, and has established itself also on the coasts of Eastern North
America.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Scaphirhynchus.</span>—Snout spatulate; posterior part of the
tail attenuated and depressed, so that it is entirely enveloped
by the osseous scutes. Spiracles none. The caudal rays do not
extend to the extremity of the tail, which terminates in a
filament.</p>
</div>

<p>Four species are known: one (<i>S. platyrhynchus</i>) from the
river-system of the Mississippi, and the three others from Central
Asia; all are exclusively freshwater fishes; their occurrence in so
widely distant rivers is one of the most striking instances by which
the close affinity of the North American and North Asiatic faunas is
proved.</p>


<h6 class="smcap">Second Family—Polyodontidæ.</h6>

<p><i>Body naked, or with minute stellate ossifications. Mouth lateral,
very wide, with minute teeth in both jaws. Barbels none. Caudal fin
with fulcra. Dorsal and anal fins approximate to the caudal. Four gills
and a half; no opercular gill or pseudobranchia.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Polyodon</span> (<span class="smcap">Spatularia</span>).—The snout is produced
into an exceedingly long, shovel-like process, thin and flexible
on the sides. Spiracles present. Gill-cover terminating in
a very long tapering flap. One broad branchiostegal. Each
branchial arch with a double series of very long, fine, and
numerous gill-rakers, the two series being divided by a broad
membrane. Air-bladder cellular. Upper caudal fulcra narrow,
numerous.</p>
</div>

<p>The single species, <i>P. folium</i>, occurs in the Mississippi,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[363]</span> and
grows to a length of about six feet, of which the rostral shovel takes
about one-fourth; in young examples it is comparatively still longer.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Psephurus</span> differs from <i>Polyodon</i> in having the
rostral process less depressed and more conical. The gill-rakers
are comparatively short, in moderate number, and distant from
one another. Upper caudal fulcra enormously developed, and in
small number (six).</p>
</div>

<p><i>Psephurus gladius</i> inhabits the Yan-tse-Kiang and Hoangho, the
distribution of the <i>Polyodontidæ</i> being perfectly analogous to
that of <i>Scaphirhynchus</i>. It grows to an immense size, specimens
of 20 feet in length being mentioned by Basilewsky. The function of the
rostral process in the economy of these fishes is not yet sufficiently
explained. Martens believes that it serves as an organ of feeling,
the water of those large Asiatic and American rivers being too turbid
to admit of the Sturgeon seeing its prey, which consists of other
fishes. The eyes of <i>Psephurus</i>, as well as <i>Polyodon</i>, are
remarkably small. Both fishes are used as food.</p>

  </div>

<p>This Ganoid is confined to tropical Africa, occurring in abundance in
the rivers of the west coast and in the Upper Nile; but it has not
been found in the river-systems belonging to the Indian Ocean. It is
scarce in the Middle and Lower Nile, and the specimens found below the
Cataracts have been carried down, from southern latitudes, and do not
propagate their species in that part of the river. There is only one
species known, <i>Polypterus bichir</i> (“Bichir” being its vernacular
name in Egypt), which varies in the number of the dorsal finlets,
the lowest being eight, the highest eighteen. It attains to a length
of four feet. Nothing is known of its mode of life, and observations
thereon are very desirable.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Calamoichthys.</span>—Distinguished from <i>Polypterus</i> by

<h6 class="smcap">Second Family—Saurodipteridæ.</h6>

<p><i>Scales ganoid, smooth like the surface of the skull. Two
dorsal fins; paired fins obtusely lobate. Teeth conical. Caudal

from Devonian and Carboniferous formations.</p>


<h6 class="smcap">Third Family—Coelacanthidæ.</h6>

<p><i>Scales cycloid. Two dorsal fins, each supported by a single
two-pronged interspinous bone; paired fins obtusely lobate. Air-bladder
ossified; notochord persistent, diphycercal.</i></p>

<p>Extinct. <i>Coelacanthus</i> from carboniferous strata; several other
genera, from the coal formations to the chalk, have been associated
with it—<i>Undina</i>, <i>Graphiurus</i>, <i>Macropoma</i>,
<i>Holophagus</i>, <i>Hoplopygus</i>, <i>Rhizodus</i>.</p>


<h6 class="smcap">Fourth Family—Holoptychiidæ.</h6>

<p><i>Scales cycloid or ganoid, sculptured. Two dorsal fins; pectorals
narrow, acutely lobate; dentition dendrodont.</i></p>

<p>Extinct. In this family a peculiar type of dentition is found—the
jaws are armed with two kinds of teeth, small ones serially arranged,
and much larger fang-like teeth disposed at long intervals. Both
kinds show at their base in transverse sections a labyrinthic
complexity of structure, numerous fissures radiating from the central
mass of vasodentine which fills up the pulp cavity, and sending
off small ramifying branches. Genera belonging to this family
are <i>Holoptychius</i>, <i>Saurichthys</i>, <i>Glyptolepis</i>,
<i>Dendrodus</i>, <i>Glyptolaemus</i>, <i>Glyptopomus</i>,
<i>Tristichopterus</i>, <i>Gyroptychius</i>, <i>Strepsodus</i>, from

<h5 class="smaller">SIXTH SUB-ORDER—PYCNODONTOIDEI.</h5>

<p><i>Body compressed, high and short or oval, covered with rhombic scales
arranged in decussating pleurolepidal lines. Notochord persistent.
Paired fins without axial skeleton. Teeth on the palate and hinder part
of the lower jaw molar-like. Branchiostegals, but no gular plates.</i></p>

<p>Extinct. The regular lozenge-shaped pattern of the integuments of these
fishes is described by Sir P. Egerton thus: “Each scale bears upon its
inner anterior margin a thick solid bony rib, extending upwards beyond
the margin of the scale, and sliced off obliquely, above and below, on
opposite sides, for forming splices with the corresponding processes
of the adjoining scales. These splices are so closely adjusted that,
without a magnifying power or an accidental dislocation, they are not
perceptible. When <i>in situ</i>, and seen internally, these continuous
lines decussate with the true vertebral apophyses.” In some genera the
“pleurolepidal” lines are confined to the anterior part of the side.</p>


<h6 class="smcap">First Family—Pleurolepidæ.</h6>

the tertiary forms, so as to simulate vertebræ. Paired fins not lobate.
Obtuse teeth on the palate and the sides of the mandible; maxilla
toothless; incisor-like teeth in the intermaxillary and front of the
mandible. Fulcra absent in all the fins.</i></p>

<p>These fishes abound in Mesozoic and Tertiary formations.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[367]</span>
<i>Gyrodus</i>, <i>Mesturus</i>, <i>Microdon</i>, <i>Coelodus</i>,

<p>Fishes of this genus existed already in Tertiary times; their remains
have been found in Europe as well as North America. In our period
they are limited to the temperate parts of North America, Central
America, and Cuba. Three species can be distinguished which attain
to a length of about six feet. They feed on other fishes, and their
general resemblance to a pike has given to them the vernacular names of
“Gar-Pike,” or “Bony Pike.”</p>

<p>Extinct. The type genus of this family is <i>Lepidotus</i>, so named
from its large rhombic, dense, and polished scales.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[369]</span> The dorsal is
opposite to the anal, and all the fins are provided with a double row
of fulcra. This genus ranges from the Lias to the Chalk; one species

<p>The “Bow-fin” or “Mud-fish” (<i>A. calva</i>) is not uncommon in many
of the fresh waters of the United States; it grows to a length of two
feet. Little is known about its habits; small fish, crustaceans, and
aquatic insects, have been found in its stomach. Wilder has observed
its respiratory actions; it rises to the surface, and, without emitting
any air-bubble whatever, opens the jaws widely, and apparently gulps in
a large quantity of air; these acts of respiration are more frequently
performed when the water is foul or has not been changed; and there
is no doubt that an exchange of oxygen and carbonic acid is effected,
as in the lungs of aërial vertebrates. The flesh of this fish is not
esteemed.</p>

<p>Fossil remains occur in tertiary deposits of North America, for
instance in the Wyoming territory; they have been distinguished as

completely formed vertebræ; vertebral column diphycercal or homocercal;
branchiæ free.</i><a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>The Teleostei form the majority of the fishes of the present fauna, and
are the geological successors of the Palæichthyes, undoubted Teleostei
not ranging farther back than the Chalk. This sub-class comprises an
infinite variety of forms; and as, naturally, many Ganoid fishes lived
under similar external conditions, and led a similar mode of life as
certain Teleostei, we find not a few analogous forms in both series:
some Ganoids resembling externally the Teleosteous Siluroids, others
the Clupeoids, others the Chætodonts, others the Scombresoces, etc.
But there is no direct genetic relation between those fishes, as some
Naturalists were inclined to believe.</p>

<p>The Teleostei are divided into six orders:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A. <span class="smcap">Acanthopterygii.</span>—Part of the rays of the dorsal,
anal, and ventral fins not articulated, spines. The lower

lower pharyngeals coalesced. Air-bladder without pneumatic duct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[374]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. Anacanthini.</span>—Vertical and ventral fins without
spinous rays. Ventral fins, if present, jugular or thoracic.
Air-bladder, if present, without pneumatic duct. Lower
pharyngeals separate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">D. Physostomi.</span>—All the fin rays articulated; only the
first of the dorsal and pectoral fins is sometimes ossified.
Ventral fins, if present, abdominal, without spine. Air-bladder,
if present, with a pneumatic duct.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E. Lophobranchii.</span>—Gills not laminated, but composed
of small rounded lobes, attached to the branchial arches.
Gill-cover reduced to a large simple plate. A dermal skeleton
replaces more or less soft integuments.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F. Plectognathi.</span>—A soft dorsal fin opposite to the
anal; sometimes elements of a spinous dorsal. Ventral fins none,
or reduced to spines. Gills pectinate; air-bladder without

</div>


<h4 class="smaller">FIRST ORDER—ACANTHOPTERYGII.</h4>

<p><i>Part of the rays of the dorsal, anal, and ventral fins are not
articulated, more or less pungent spines. The lower pharyngeals are
generally separate. Air-bladder, if present, without pneumatic duct in
the adult.</i><a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

moderate extent, rather longer than, or as long as, the soft; the soft
anal similar to the soft dorsal, of moderate extent or rather short.
Ventrals thoracic, with one spine and with four or five rays.</i></p>


<h6 class="smcap">First Family—Percidæ.</h6>

<p><i>The scales extend but rarely over the vertical fins, and the lateral
line is generally present, continuous from the head to the caudal fin.
All the teeth simple and conical; no barbels. No bony stay for the
præoperculum.</i></p>

<p>A large family, represented by numerous genera and species in fresh
waters, and on all the coasts of the temperate and tropical regions.
Carnivorous.</p>

<p>Fossil Percoids abound in some formations, for instance, at Monte
Bolca, where species of <i>Labrax</i>, <i>Lates</i>, <i>Smerdis</i>
and <i>Cyclopoma</i> (both extinct), <i>Dules</i>, <i>Serranus</i>,
<i>Apogon</i>, <i>Therapon</i>, and <i>Pristipoma</i> have been
recognised. <i>Paraperca</i> is a genus recently discovered in the
Marles of Aix-en-Provence. A species of <i>Perca</i> is known from the
freshwater deposit of Oeningen.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Perca.</span>—All the teeth are villiform, without canines;
teeth on the palatine bones and vomer; tongue toothless. Two
dorsal fins, the first with thirteen or fourteen spines; anal
fin with two spines. Præoperculum and præorbital serrated.
Scales small; head naked above. Branchiostegals seven. Vertebræ
more than twenty-four.</p>
</div>

<p>The “Freshwater Perch” (<i>Perca fluviatilis</i>) is too familiarly
known to require description. It is generally distributed over Europe
and Northern Asia; and equally common in North America, there being
no sufficient ground for separating specifically the specimens of the
Western Hemisphere. It frequents especially still waters, and sometimes
descends into brackish water. Its weight does not seem to exceed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[376]</span> 5
lbs. The female deposits her ova, united together by a viscid matter,
in lengthened or net-shaped bands, on waterplants. The number of the
eggs of one spawn may exceed a million. Two other species, <i>P.
gracilis</i>, from Canada, and <i>P. schrenckii</i>, from Turkestan,
have been distinguished, but they are very imperfectly known. An allied
genus is <i>Siniperca</i>, from Northern China.</p>

</div>

<p>These fishes represent the Freshwater Perches of the Northern
Hemisphere in the fresh waters of the temperate parts of South America.
Two species have been described from Patagonia, and one or two from
Chili and Peru.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Labrax.</span>—All the teeth are villiform, without canines;
teeth on the palatine bones, vomer, and the tongue. Two dorsal

Præoperculum serrated, and with denticulations along its lower
limb; præorbital with the margin entire. Scales rather small.
Branchiostegals seven; well developed pseudobranchiæ.</p>
</div>

<p>The “Bass” are fishes common on the coasts of Europe and the Atlantic
coasts, and in the fresh waters of the United States and Canada. The
three European species are almost exclusively inhabitants of the sea,
entering brackish, but never fresh waters, whilst the American species,
the number<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[377]</span> of which is still uncertain, seem to affect principally
fresh water, although some are also found in the sea. The best known
European species is <i>Labrax lupus</i> (see p. 41, Fig. <a href="#fig4">4</a>), common on
the British coasts. It is a voracious fish, with a remarkably large
stomach, and received from the ancient Romans the appropriate name of
<i>lupus</i>. By the Greeks it was so highly esteemed that Archestratus
termed this or one of the two other closely-allied species, taken near
Milet, “offspring of the gods.” They attributed to it a tender regard
for its own safety; and Aristotle says that it is the most cunning of
fishes; and that, when surrounded by the net, it digs for itself a
channel of escape through the sand. Specimens of from two to three feet
are not scarce, but its flesh is nowadays much less esteemed than in
ancient times. Of the North American species <i>Labrax lineatus</i> and
<i>Labrax rufus</i> are the most common.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Lates.</span>—All the teeth are villiform, without canines;
teeth on the palatine bones and vomer, but none on the tongue.
Two dorsal fins—the first with seven or eight, the anal fin
with two or three, spines. Præoperculum with strong spines at
the angle and the lower limb; also the præorbital is strongly
serrated. Scales of moderate size. Branchiostegals seven;
pseudobranchiæ present.</p>
</div>

<p>Three well-known species belong to this genus. The Perch of the
Nile and other rivers of tropical Africa (<i>Lates niloticus</i>);
the Perch of the Ganges and other East Indian rivers, which enters
freely brackish water, and extends to the rivers of Queensland
(<i>Lates calcarifer</i>). These two species attain to a large size,
the Indian species to a length of five feet. Hamilton says that “the
vulgar English in Calcutta call it ‘Cockup,’ and that it is one of
the lightest and most esteemed foods brought to table in that city.”
Specimens two feet in length and caught in salt water are by far the
best quality. The third species (<i>Lates colonorum</i>) is found in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[378]</span>
Australia only, and does not appear to grow to the same large size as
its congeners.</p>

<p>Allied to <i>Lates</i> is <i>Psammoperca</i> from Australia.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Percalabrax.</span>—All the teeth villiform, without canines;
teeth on the palatine bones and vomer, but none on the tongue.
Two dorsal fins—the first with eleven, the anal fin with three
spines. Præoperculum serrated along its hinder margin, and with
strong spinous teeth below; præorbital not serrated. Scales
rather small. Branchiostegals seven; pseudobranchiæ present.</p>
</div>

<p>This Perch (<i>Percalabrax japonicus</i>) is one of the most common
fishes on the coasts of China, Japan, and Formosa; the Japanese name it
“Zuzuki,” or “Seengo.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Acerina.</span>—All the teeth villiform, without canines;
teeth on the vomer, but none on the palatine bones or the
tongue. One continuous dorsal fin, of which the spinous portion
consists of from thirteen to nineteen spines; two anal spines.
Body rather low, with rather small scales. Bones of the skull
with wide muciferous cavities; præoperculum denticulated.</p>
</div>

<p>Small freshwater perches, of which <i>A. cernua</i>, named “Pope” in
England, is the most common, and has the widest distribution in Central
Europe and Siberia. The two other species have a more restricted range,
<i>A. schrætzer</i> being confined to the Danube and other rivers
emptying into the Black Sea; and <i>A. czekanowskii</i> to Siberian
rivers. This genus is not represented in the Western Hemisphere.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The “Pike-Perches” are inhabitants of many lakes and rivers of the
temperate northern zone. The European species is confined to the
eastern two-thirds of the continent, and one of the most esteemed
freshwater fishes; it attains to a length of three or four feet,
and to a weight of from 25 to 30 lbs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[379]</span> It has been recommended for
acclimatisation in England, and there is no doubt that in certain
localities it might prove a valuable addition to the native fauna; but
like all its congeners it is very voracious and destructive to smaller
fishes. Two other species inhabit rivers of European and Asiatic
Russia, and two or three the fresh waters of North America.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Pileoma.</span>—All the teeth minute, villiform, without
canines; teeth on the vomer and palatine bones. Two dorsal

elongate, with small scales. Præoperculum not serrated.</p>
</div>

<p>Small freshwater perches abundant in the United States. Like the
following genus, and some others which need not be mentioned here,
they can be regarded as small, dwarfed representatives of the
preceding genera. The species seem to be numerous, but have not yet
been sufficiently well distinguished. The latest and best account of
them is by L. Vaillant, “Recherches sur les Poissons d’eaux douces de
l’Amérique septentrionale (<i>Etheostomatidæ</i>),” in Nouv. Archiv. du
Muséum d’Hist. Nat. de Paris, ix., 1873.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[380]</span></p>

<p>Numerous species are known from the West Indies and Central America.
These fishes are found in fresh, brackish, and salt water, and some of
the species indiscriminately enter all three kinds of water. They do
not grow to any large size, but are esteemed as food.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Enoplosus.</span>—Body much elevated, the depth being still
more increased by the high vertical fins. All the teeth are
villiform, without canines; teeth on the vomer, palatine bones,

Præoperculum serrated, with spinous teeth at the angle. Scales
of moderate size.</p>
</div>

<p>A small and very common marine species (<i>E. armatus</i>) on the coast
of Australia, especially New South Wales. It is readily recognised by
the peculiar shape of its body, and eight black transverse bands on a
whitish ground.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>This, and the preceding genus, leads to the true “Sea perches,” which
never, or but rarely, enter fresh water:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Centropristis.</span>—Body oblong, with scales of small or
moderate size. Teeth villiform, with small canines in both jaws;
vomerine teeth placed in an angular band, or a short triangular
patch; teeth on the palatine bones, but none on the tongue.
One dorsal, with the formula 10/12 or less; anal fin 3/7(6).
Præoperculum serrated; sometimes with the angle projecting, and
armed with long spines.</p>
</div>

<p>About twenty species of small size are known from temperate and
tropical seas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anthias.</span>—Body rather short, compressed, with scales of
moderate size. Teeth villiform, with small canines in both jaws; teeth
on the vomer, and palatine teeth. One dorsal, generally with ten
spines; anal fin with three; caudal forked. The rays of one or more
fins may be prolonged. Præoperculum serrated.</p>

<p>About twenty species are known from temperate and tropical seas; they
are mostly of small size, and agreeably coloured, pink and yellow
being the predominant colours. <i>Anthias sacer</i> is common in the
Mediterranean, and was well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[381]</span> known to the ancients. Aristotle says that
the fishers of Sponges call it sacred, because no voracious fishes came
to the places which it frequented, and the diver might descend with
safety.—<i>Callanthias</i> is a genus closely allied to <i>Anthias</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Serranus.</span>—Body oblong, compressed, with small scales.
Teeth villiform, with very distinct canines in both jaws;
teeth on the vomer and palatine bones, none on the tongue. One
dorsal, mostly with nine or eleven, rarely with eight, ten or
twelve spines; anal fin with three: all the spines being stout.

  </div>

<p>The “Sea perches proper” are found on the shores of all temperate and
tropical seas, most abundantly in the latter. A few species enter
brackish and even fresh water, one having been found as high up the
Ganges as the confines of Nepal. However, all spawn in the sea. The
variety of species is almost infinite, about 150 being tolerably
well known, and many more having been described. The distinction of
the species is most difficult, and nearly impossible to those who
have no opportunity of closely and long observing them in nature,
as they are not only subject to great variation of colour, but also
to considerable changes dependent on age. Many are most agreeably
coloured, and ornamented with spots, or cross bands or longitudinal
stripes; colours which become more uniform with age in those species
which attain to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[382]</span> large size. The majority remain of rather small
size, growing to a length of one or two feet; but not a few reach more
than twice that length, and may even become dangerous to man. Instances
of bathers having been attacked by a gigantic species not uncommon at
the Seychelles and Aden are on record, the persons having died from the
injuries received. Almost all the species are eatable, and many are
esteemed as food. One species is common on the British coasts (<i>S.
cabrilla</i>), and probably some of the more southern species (<i>S.
scriba</i> and <i>S. gigas</i>) occasionally wander as far northwards
as the British Channel. The species figured, <i>S. altvelis</i>, is
locally distributed over nearly all the tropical parts of the Indian
Ocean, and distinguished by particularly high dorsal and anal fins.
<i>Anyperodon</i> and <i>Prionodes</i> are two genera closely allied to
<i>Serranus</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Plectropoma.</span>—Form of the body and dentition (see
p. 127, Fig. <a href="#fig54">54</a>) similar to that of <i>Serranus</i>, with a
præoperculum serrated behind, and armed with spinous teeth
below, which are directed forwards. Dorsal fin with from seven
to thirteen spines.</p>
</div>

<p>About thirty species from tropical seas are known. <i>Trachypoma</i> is
allied to this genus.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Polyprion.</span>—Body oblong, rather compressed, covered

strong, rough, longitudinal ridge on the operculum.</p>
</div>

<p>Two species are known: one from the European coasts (<i>P.
cernium</i>), and one from Juan Fernandez (<i>P. kneri</i>). They
attain to a weight of 80 lbs. and more. The European species has the
habit of accompanying floating wood, to which they are attracted by
the small marine species generally surrounding such objects, and
affording a supply of food. It is known by the name of “Stone-bass,”
and excellent eating.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Grammistes.</span>—Body rather short, compressed, covered
with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[383]</span> minute scales imbedded in the thick skin. All the teeth

dorsal fins, the first with seven spines. Præoperculum without
serrature, but with three short spines. A short skinny barbel is
frequently developed at the chin.</p>
</div>

<p>Three species are known from the Indo-Pacific; they are of small
size. One, <i>G. orientalis</i>, is black, with six or seven white
longitudinal stripes, and one of the most common coast-fishes of that
ocean.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Rhypticus.</span>—Body oblong, compressed, covered with
minute scales imbedded in the thick skin. All the teeth are
villiform; teeth on the vomer and palatine bones. The spines
of the vertical fins are but little developed, always in small
number and short, and may disappear entirely. Præoperculum not
serrated, with some obtuse spines.</p>
</div>

<p>Four species are known: three from the West Indies and one from the
Galapagoes Islands.</p>

<p>Other genera allied to the two preceding are <i>Aulacocephalus</i> from
Mauritius, Reunion, and Japan; and <i>Myriodon</i> from the coasts of
Australia.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

with ten or eleven, rarely with more spines; anal fin with
three. Præoperculum serrated; in some species (<i>Genyoroge</i>)
a more or less distinct spinous knob projects from the surface
of the interoperculum, and is received in a more or less deep
notch of the præopercular margin.</p>

<p>About seventy species are known from tropical seas in both hemispheres,
but it is noteworthy that the species with the peculiar protuberance
of the interoperculum are confined to the Indo-Pacific. The coloration
is much more simple than in the small-scaled Serrani, a uniform hue
of greenish, pink, or red prevailing; species with longitudinal bands
are scarce, but not rarely dark cross-bands or a large spot on the
side occur. The majority of the species remain within very moderate
dimensions, specimens exceeding three feet in length being scarce. They
are generally eaten, and some of the species belong to the commonest
fishes of the tropics, as <i>M. bengalensis</i>, <i>chrysurus</i>,
<i>gembra</i>, <i>griseus</i>, and others.</p>

<p><i>Glaucosoma</i> from Japan and Australia is allied to
<i>Mesoprion</i>.</p>

<p>About twenty species are known, the distribution of which nearly
coincides with <i>Dules</i>, but as some of the species are more or
less marine, the genus is spread over the whole area of the tropical
Indo-Pacific. Other species, especially those of Australian rivers, are
entirely limited to fresh water. <i>Th. theraps</i>, <i>Th. servus</i>,
and <i>Th. cuvieri</i> belong to the most common fishes of that area,
extending from the east coast of Africa to Polynesia. They are readily
recognised by the blackish longitudinal bands with which the body
is ornamented. All the species are of small size. <i>Helotes</i> is
closely allied to this genus.</p>

They live in the seas between the Tropics, and some, perhaps all, of
the species enter fresh water. Very rarely they exceed a length of ten

and palatine bones. One dorsal, with eleven spines; anal with
three; caudal fin rounded. Præoperculum with a single smooth or
obtusely denticulated margin.</p>
</div>

<p>To this genus belong two fishes well known on account of the excellent
flavour of their flesh. The first (<i>O. macquariensis</i>) is called
by the colonists “Murray-Cod,” being plentiful in the Murray River
and other rivers of South Australia. It attains to a length of more
than three feet, and to a weight of nearly 100 lbs. The second (<i>O.
gigas</i>) is found in the sea, on the coast of New Zealand, and called
by the Maoris and colonists “Hapuku.” Its average weight is about 45
lbs., but occasionally large specimens of more than a hundredweight
are caught. At certain localities it is so plentiful that it may form
an important article of trade. Dr. Hector, who has had opportunity of
examining it in a fresh state, has pointed out anatomical differences
from the Murray-Cod, from which it appears that it would be better
placed in a distinct genus.</p>

  </div>

<p>Three species are known, from the coasts of Southern Australia and New
Zealand. They are named by the colonists Salmon or Trout, from their
elegant form and lively habits, and from the sport they afford to the
angler. Their usual size is from 1 to 3 lbs., but specimens of double
that weight are taken. The smaller specimens are the more delicate and
better flavoured. When not fresh, they are liable to assume poisonous
properties; and cases of poisoning are not unfrequently caused by them.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Huro.</span>—Body oblong, compressed, covered with scales
of moderate size. All the teeth villiform; bones of the head
without serrature. Mouth rather oblique, with the lower jaw
projecting. Two dorsal fins, the first with six spines.</p>
</div>

<p>The “Black Bass” of Lake Huron (<i>Huro nigricans</i>).</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Ambassis.</span>—Body short, strongly compressed, covered
with large thin deciduous scales. Mouth oblique, with the lower
jaw longest; teeth villiform, without conspicuously larger
canines; teeth on the vomer and palatine bones. Two dorsal fins,
the first with seven, the anal with three spines; a horizontal
spine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[394]</span> pointing forwards in front of the dorsal fin. The lower
limb of the præoperculum with a double serrated margin.</p>
</div>

<p>This genus comprises the smallest of all Percoids, some of the species
not much exceeding one inch in length. They are most abundant on the
coasts of the tropical Indo-Pacific, and in the fresh waters belonging
to that area. The species are numerous (some thirty having been
described), and very difficult to distinguish. Their coloration is very
plain, a silvery hue prevailing over the whole fish.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Apogon.</span>—Body rather short, covered with large
deciduous scales. Mouth oblique, with the lower jaw longest;

  </div>

<p>Although of similarly small size, the fishes of this genus represent a
more highly developed form of the Percoid type than <i>Ambassis</i>.
Their distribution coincides very much with that of <i>Ambassis</i>,
but they are chiefly marine, comparatively few of the species entering
fresh water. They belong to the kind of fishes which, from their habit,
are termed “Coral Fishes,” being found in greatest abundance on, or
in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[395]</span> neighbourhood of, coral reefs, in company with Chætodonts,
Pomacentridæ, and others. Their colours also are ornamental and highly
diversified, as is generally the case in coral fishes, the majority of
the species showing transverse or longitudinal bands or large spots,
and numerous other smaller markings which, in the dead fish, soon
disappear. Nearly one hundred species have been described, of which
a few only occur in the Atlantic, one extending northwards into the
Mediterranean.</p>

<p><i>Chilodipterus</i>, <i>Acropoma</i>, and <i>Scombrops</i> are allied
genera, but with canine teeth in one or both jaws.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Pomatomus.</span>—Body oblong, covered with scales of
moderate size. Eye very large. All the teeth villiform, without
canines; teeth on the vomer and palatine bones. Two dorsal fins,
the first with seven, the anal with two spines. No serration on
any of the bones of the head. Branchiostegals seven.</p>
</div>

<p>One species only is known, <i>P. telescopium</i>, which grows to a
length of nearly two feet. It is not uncommon in the Mediterranean and
neighbouring parts of the Atlantic, but only occasionally caught, as it
lives habitually at a greater depth than any other Percoid as far as is
known at present, probably at depths from 80 to 200 fathoms; a habit
sufficiently indicated by its exceedingly large eye.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Priacanthus.</span>—Body short, compressed, covered with small rough
scales, which extend also over the short snout. Lower jaw and chin
prominent. Eye large. All the teeth villiform, without canines; teeth
on the vomer and palatine bones. One dorsal fin with ten spines, anal
with three. Præoperculum serrated, with a more or less prominent, flat,
triangular spine at the angle.</p>

<p>A very natural genus, easily recognised, and without direct relation to
the other Percoid genera. The species, of which seventeen are known,
are spread over nearly all the tropical seas, and belong to the more
common fishes. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[396]</span> scarcely exceed a length of twelve inches, and are
very uniformly coloured, red, pink, and silvery prevailing.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p class="p-left">The following three genera form a group by themselves,
which, however, is defined rather by its geographical limits and
similarity of general appearance than by distinctive anatomical
characters. The species are abundant in the fresh waters of the United
States, and well known by the name of “Sun Fishes.” They rarely exceed
a length of six inches, and are not used as food. The number of species
is uncertain.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Centrarchus.</span>—Body short, compressed, with scales of
moderate size. All the teeth villiform, without canines; teeth
on the vomer, palatines, and on the tongue. One dorsal fin; anal
generally with more than three spines. Præoperculum without
serrature; operculum not lobed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bryttus.</span>—Body short, compressed, with scales of
moderate size. All the teeth villiform, without canines; teeth
on the vomer and palatine bones. One dorsal fin with nine
or ten, anal with three spines. Præoperculum not serrated;
operculum with a rounded membranaceous coloured lobe behind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pomotis.</span>—Body short, compressed, with scales of
moderate length. All the teeth villiform, without canines; teeth
on the vomer, but none on the palatine bones. One dorsal, with
from nine to eleven spines, anal with three. Præoperculum entire
or minutely serrated; operculum with a rounded membranaceous
coloured lobe behind.</p>
</div>

<hr class="tb">

<p class="p-left">A <span class="smcap">North American</span> Freshwater genus,
<i>Aphredoderus</i>, occupies a perfectly isolated position in the
system, and is evidently the type of a distinct family. It resembles
the “Sun-fishes” of the same country with regard to the structure of
the vertical fins, but has the vent situated in front of the ventrals,
which are composed of more than five soft rays. The body is oblong,
compressed, covered with ctenoid scales. The dorsal fin is single, and
has three spines in front. Infraorbital and præoperculum with spinous
teeth. Villiform teeth in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">[397]</span> jaws, on the vomer and palatine bones.
<i>A. sayanus</i> from the southern streams and fresh waters of the
Atlantic States.</p>

<p class="p-left">To complete the list of Percoid genera, we have to
mention the following:—<i>Siniperca</i>, <i>Etelis</i>, <i>Niphon</i>,
<i>Aprion</i>, <i>Apsilus</i>, <i>Pentaceros</i>, <i>Velifer</i>,
<i>Datnioides</i>, <i>Percilia</i>, <i>Lanioperca</i>.</p>


<h6 class="smcap">Second Family—Squamipinnes.</h6>

<p><i>Body compressed and elevated, covered with scales, either finely
ctenoid or smooth. Lateral line continuous, not continued over the
caudal fin. Mouth in front of the snout, generally small, with lateral
cleft. Eye lateral, of moderate size. Six or seven branchiostegals.
Teeth villiform or setiform, in bands, without canines or incisors.
Dorsal fin consisting of a spinous and soft portion of nearly equal
development; anal with three or four spines, similarly developed as
the soft dorsal, both being many-rayed. The vertical fins more or less
densely covered with small scales. The lower rays of the pectoral fin
branched, not enlarged; ventrals thoracic, with one spine and five soft
rays. Stomach coecal.</i></p>

<p>The typical forms of this family are readily recognised by the form
of their body, and by a peculiarity from which they derive their name
<i>Squamipinnes</i>; the soft, and frequently also the spinous part
of their dorsal and anal fins are so thickly covered with scales
that the boundary between fins and body is entirely obliterated. The
majority are inhabitants of the tropical seas, and abound chiefly
in the neighbourhood of coral-reefs. The beauty and singularity of
distribution of the colours of some of the genera, as <i>Chætodon</i>,
<i>Heniochus</i>, <i>Holacanthus</i>, is scarcely surpassed by any
other group of fishes. They remain within small dimensions, and
comparatively few are used as food. They are carnivorous, feeding on
small invertebrates. Only a few species enter brackish water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">[398]</span></p>

<p>Extinct representatives of this family are not scarce at Monte
Bolca and in other tertiary formations. All, at least those
admitting of definite determination, belong to existing genera,
viz. <i>Holacanthus</i>, <i>Pomacanthus</i>, <i>Ephippium</i>,
<i>Scatophagus</i>. Very singular is the occurrence of <i>Toxotes</i>
in the Monte Bolca strata.</p>

<p>The following genera have no teeth on the palate:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Chætodon.</span>—One dorsal fin, without any notch in
its upper margin, and with the soft and spinous portions
similarly developed; none of the spines elongate. Snout short
or of moderate length. Præoperculum without, or with a fine,
serration, and without spine at the angle. Scales generally
large or of moderate size.</p>

  </div>

<p>Seventy species are known from the tropical parts of the Atlantic and
Indo-Pacific, nearly all being beautifully ornamented with bands or
spots. Of the ornamental markings a dark or bicoloured band, passing
through the eye and ascending towards the back, is very generally
found in these fishes; it frequently occurs again in other marine
Acanthopterygians, in which it is not rarely a sign of the immature
condition of the individual. The Chætodonts are most numerous in the
neighbourhood of the coral-reefs of the Indo-Pacific, the species
figured (<i>C. ephippium</i>) being as common<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[399]</span> in the East Indian
Archipelago as in Polynesia, like many others of its congeners.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Chelmo</span> differs from <i>Chætodon</i> only in having the

  </div>

<p>Only four species are known, locally distributed in the tropical seas.
<i>Ch. rostratus</i>, the oldest species known, is said to have the
instinct of throwing a drop of water from its bill so as to light
upon any insect resting on a leaf, and thus make it fall, that it may
instantly dart upon it. This statement is erroneous, and probably rests
upon the mistaken notion that the long bill is especially adapted for
this manœuvre, which, indeed, is practised by another fish of this
family (<i>Toxotes</i>). The long slender bill of Chelmo (which is a
true saltwater fish) rather enables it to draw from holes and crevices
animals which otherwise could not be reached by it.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Heniochus.</span>—One dorsal, with from eleven to thirteen
spines, the fourth of which is more or less elongate and
filiform. Snout<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[400]</span> rather short or of moderate length.
Præoperculum without spine. Scales of moderate size.</p>
</div>

<p>Four species are known from the tropical Indo-Pacific. <i>H.
macrolepidotus</i> is one of the most common fishes of that area; the
species figured (<i>H. varius</i>) retains in a conspicuous manner
horn-like protuberances on bones of the head, with which the young of
all the species of this genus seem to be armed.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="fig169" style="max-width: 375px">

<p><span class="smcap">Holacanthus.</span>—Præoperculum with a strong spine at the

moderate or small size.</p>
</div>

<p>Forty species are known, which, in their geographical distribution
accompany, and are quite analogous to, the Chætodonts. One of the most
common and most beautiful is called “Emperor of Japan” by the Dutch,
which name has been adopted by Bloch for its specific designation,
<i>Holacanthus imperator</i>. Its body is blue, longitudinally
traversed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[401]</span> by about thirty yellow bands; the ocular band, and the
side behind the head, are black, edged with yellow; the caudal fin
is yellow. It is a large species of this genus, sometimes attaining
a length of 15 inches, and as an article of food is one of the most
esteemed of all the Indian species. With regard to beauty of colours
it is surpassed by another allied species, <i>H. diacanthus</i>, which
likewise ranges from the east coast of Africa to Polynesia.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Pomacanthus</span> differs from <i>Holacanthus</i> in having
from eight to ten spines only in the dorsal fin.</p>
</div>

<p>The single species (<i>P. paru</i>) on which this genus is founded is
one of the most common fishes of the West Indies, and offers one of
the most remarkable instances of variation of colour within the limits
of the same species: some specimens being ornamented with more or less
distinct yellowish cross-bands, others with yellow crescent-shaped
spots; in others black spots predominate.</p>

<p>Two or three species are known from the warmer parts of the Atlantic
and Indian Oceans. The Atlantic species (<i>E. faber</i>) shows the
remarkable peculiarity that in old specimens (12 and more inches long)
the occipital crest, and sometimes some of the anterior neural and
hæmal spines are enormously enlarged into a globular bony mass. This
can hardly be regarded as a pathological change of the bone, as it has
been found in all old specimens, without exception.</p>

<p><i>Drepane</i> is allied to <i>Ephippus</i>, but has very long
falciform pectoral fins. The single species <i>D. punctata</i>
is common in the Indian Ocean and on the coasts of Australia.
<i>Hypsinotus</i>, from Japan, appears to inhabit a greater depth than
the other Squamipinnes.</p>

<p><i>Scorpis</i> and <i>Atypichthys</i> are genera distinguished from
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">[403]</span> preceding by the presence of vomerine teeth. They belong to the
coast-fauna of Australia, New Zealand, and Chili.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Toxotes.</span>—Body short, compressed, covered with scales

  </div>

<p>Two species are known from the East Indies, one (<i>T. jaculator</i>),
which is the more common, ranging to the north coast of Australia. It
has received its name from its habit of throwing a drop of water at an
insect which it perceives close to the surface, in order to make it
fall into it. The Malays, who call it “Ikan sumpit,” keep it in a bowl,
in order to witness this singular habit, which it continues even in
captivity.</p>


<h6 class="smcap">Third Family—Mullidæ.</h6>

<p><i>Body rather low and slightly compressed, covered with large thin
scales, without or with an extremely fine serrature. Two long erectile
barbels are suspended from the hyoid, and are received between the rami
of the lower jaw and opercles. Lateral line continuous. Mouth in front
of the snout, with the cleft<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">[404]</span> lateral and rather short; teeth very
feeble. Eye lateral, of moderate size. Two short dorsal fins remote
from each other, the first with feeble spines; anal similar to the
second dorsal. Ventrals with one spine and five rays. Pectorals short.
Branchiostegals four; stomach siphonal.</i></p>

<p>The “Red Mullets” form a very natural family, which, on account of
slight modifications of the dentition, has been divided into several
sub-genera—<i>Upeneoides</i>, <i>Upeneichthys</i>, <i>Mullus</i>,
<i>Mulloides</i>, and <i>Upeneus</i>. They are marine fishes, but many
species enter brackish water to feed on the animalcules abounding in
the flora of brack-water. About forty different species are known
chiefly from tropical seas, the European species (<i>M. barbatus</i>,
see p. 43, Fig. <a href="#fig7">7</a>), extending far northwards into the temperate zone.
None attain to a large size, specimens of from two to three lbs. being
not common, but all are highly esteemed as food.</p>

<p>The most celebrated is the European species (of which there is one
only, <i>M. surmuletus</i> being probably the female). The ancient
Romans called it <i>Mullus</i>, the Greeks τριγλη. The Romans priced it
above any other fish; they sought for large specimens far and wide, and
paid ruinous prices for them.</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
   <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i4h">“Mullus tibi quatuor emptus</div>

        <div class="right"><span class="smcap">Martial</span>, x. 31.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>Then, as nowadays, it was considered essential for the enjoyment of
this delicacy that the fish should exhibit the red colour of its
integuments. The Romans brought it, for that purpose, living into the
banqueting room, and allowed it to die in the hands of the guests, the
red colour appearing in all its brilliancy during the death struggle of
the fish. The fishermen of our times attain the same object by scaling
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">[405]</span> fish immediately after its capture, thus causing a permanent
contraction of the chromatophors containing the red pigment (see p.
183).</p>


<h6 class="smcap">Fourth Family—Sparidæ.</h6>

<p><i>Body compressed, oblong, covered with scales, the serrature of which
is very minute, and sometimes altogether absent. Mouth in front of the
snout, with the cleft lateral. Eye lateral, of moderate size. Either
cutting teeth in front of the jaws, or molar teeth on the side; palate
generally toothless. One dorsal fin, formed by a spinous and soft
portion of nearly equal development. Anal fin with three spines. The
lower rays of the pectoral fin are generally branched, but in one genus
simple. Ventrals thoracic, with one spine and five rays.</i></p>

<p>The “Sea-breams” are recognised chiefly by their dentition, which is
more specialised than in the preceding families, and by which the
groups, into which this family has been divided, are characterised.
They are inhabitants of the shores of all the tropical and temperate
seas. Their coloration is very plain. They do not attain to a large
size, but the majority are used as food.</p>

<p>The extinct forms found hitherto are rather numerous; the oldest come
from the cretaceous formation of Mount Lebanon; some belong to living
genera, as <i>Sargus</i>, <i>Pagellus</i>; of others from Eocene and
Miocene formations no living representative is known—<i>Sparnodus</i>,
<i>Sargodon</i>, <i>Capitodus</i>, <i>Soricidens</i>, <i>Asima</i>.</p>

<p><i>First Group—Cantharina.</i>—More or less broad cutting, sometimes
lobate, teeth in front of the jaws; no molars or vomerine teeth;
the lower pectoral rays are branched. Partly herbivorous, partly
carnivorous. The genera belonging to this group are:—<i>Cantharus</i>
from the European and South African coasts, of which one species
(<i>C. lineatus</i>), is common on the coasts of Great Britain,
and locally known by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[406]</span> names “Old Wife,” “Black Sea-bream;”
<i>Box</i>, <i>Scatharus</i>, and <i>Oblata</i> from the Mediterranean
and neighbouring parts of the Atlantic; <i>Crenidens</i> and
<i>Tripterodon</i> from the Indian Ocean; <i>Pachymetopon</i>,
<i>Dipterodon</i>, and <i>Gymnocrotaphus</i> from the Cape of Good
Hope; <i>Girella</i> and <i>Tephræops</i> from Chinese, Japanese, and
Australian Seas; <i>Doydixodon</i> from the Galapagos Islands and the
coasts of Peru.</p>

<p><i>Second Group—Haplodactylina.</i>—In both jaws flat and generally
tricuspid teeth; no molars; vomerine teeth. The lower pectoral rays
simple, not branched. Vegetable feeders. Only one genus is known,
<i>Haplodactylus</i>, from the temperate zone of the Southern Pacific.</p>

<p><i>Third Group—Sargina.</i>—Jaws with a single series of incisors
in front, and with several series of rounded molars on the side. One
genus is known, <i>Sargus</i>, which comprises twenty species; several
of them occur in the Mediterranean and the neighbouring parts of the
Atlantic, and are popularly called “Sargo,” “Sar,” “Saragu:” names
derived from the word Sargus, by which name these fishes were well
known to the ancient Greeks and Romans. One of the largest species is
the “Sheep’s-head” (<i>Sargus ovis</i>), from the coasts of the United
States, which attains to a weight of 15 lbs., and is highly esteemed on
account of the excellency of its flesh. Singularly enough, this genus
occurs also on the east coast of Africa, one of these East-African
species being identical with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">[407]</span> <i>S. noct</i> from the Mediterranean.
These fishes evidently feed on hard-shelled animals, which they crush
with their molar teeth.</p>

<p><i>Fourth Group—Pagrina.</i>—Jaws with conical teeth in front and
molar teeth on the sides. Feeding, as the preceding, on hard-shelled
animals, like Mollusks and Crustaceans. This group is composed of
several genera:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Lethrinus.</span>—Cheeks scaleless. Body oblong, covered with
scales of moderate size (L. lat. 45–50). Canine teeth in front;
lateral teeth in a single series, broadly conical or molar-like.
Formula of the fins: D. 10/9, A. 3/8.</p>
</div>

<p>More than twenty species are known, all of which, with one exception,
occur in the tropical Indo-Pacific. The species, forming this
exception, occurs, singularly enough, on the west coast of Africa,
where more than one Indian genus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">[408]</span> reappears in isolated representative
species. Some Lethrini attain to a length of three feet.</p>

<p><i>Sphærodon</i> is closely allied to <i>Lethrinus</i>, but has scales
on the cheek. One species from the Indo-Pacific.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Pagrus.</span>—Body oblong, compressed, with scales of
moderate size. Several pairs of strong canine-like teeth in both
jaws; molars arranged in two series. Cheeks scaly. The spines
of the dorsal fin, eleven or twelve in number, are sometimes
elongate, and can be received in a groove; anal spines three.</p>
</div>

<p>Thirteen species are known, chiefly distributed in the warmer parts
of the temperate zones, and more scantily represented between the
tropics. Several species (<i>P. vulgaris, P. auriga, P. bocagii</i>)
occur in the Mediterranean and the neighbouring parts of the Atlantic;
one (<i>P. argyrops</i>) is well known on the coasts of the United
States under the names of “Scup,” “Porgy,” or “Mishcup,” and one of
the most important food fishes, growing to a length of 18 inches and a
weight of 4 lbs.; another (<i>P. unicolor</i>) is one of the best-known
sea-fishes of Southern Australia and New Zealand, where it is called
“Snapper;” it is considered very good eating, like all the other
species of this genus, and attains, like some of them, a length of more
than 3 feet and a weight exceeding 20 lbs.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Pagellus.</span>—Body oblong, compressed, with scales of
moderate size. Jaws without canines; molars on the sides
arranged in several series. Cheeks scaly. The spines of the
dorsal fin, from eleven to thirteen in number, can be received
in a groove; anal spines three.</p>
</div>

<p>Seven species are known, the majority of which are European, as
<i>P. erythrinus</i>, common in the Mediterranean, and not rare on
the south coast of England, where it is generally termed “Becker;”
<i>P. centrodontus</i>, the common “Sea-bream” of the English coasts,
distinguished by a black spot on the origin of the lateral line; in the
young, which are called “Chad” by Cornish and Devon fishermen, this
spot is absent;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">[409]</span> <i>P. owenii</i>, the “Axillary or Spanish Sea-Bream,”
likewise from the British coasts. <i>Pagellus lithognathus</i>, from
the coasts of the Cape of Good Hope, attains to a length of four feet,
and is one of the fishes which are dried for export and sale to whalers.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Chrysophrys.</span>—Body oblong, compressed, with scales of
moderate size. Jaws with four or six canine teeth in front, and
with three or more series of rounded molars on each side. Cheeks
scaly. The spines of the dorsal fin, eleven or twelve in number,
can be received in a groove; anal spines three.</p>
</div>

<p>Some twenty species are known from tropical seas and the warmer parts
of the temperate zones. Generally known is <i>Ch. aurata</i>, from
the Mediterranean, occasionally found on the south coast of England,
where it is named “Gilthead.” The French call it “Daurade,” no doubt
from the Latin <i>Aurata</i>, a term applied to it by ancient authors.
The Greeks named it Chrysophrys (<i>i.e.</i> golden eyebrow), in
allusion to the brilliant spot of gold which it bears between its
eyes. According to Columella, the Aurata was among the number of the
fishes brought up by the Romans in their vivaria; and the inventor
of those vivaria, one Sergius Orata, is supposed to have derived his
surname from this fish. It is said to grow extremely fat in artificial
ponds. Duhamel states that it stirs up the sand with the tail, so as
to discover the shell-fish concealed in it. It is extremely fond of
mussels, and its near presence is sometimes ascertained by the noise
which it makes while breaking their shells with its teeth. Several
species found on the Cape of Good Hope attain to as large a size as
<i>Pagellus lithognathus</i>, and are preserved for sale like that
species. <i>Chrysophrys hasta</i> is one of the most common species of
the East Indian and Chinese coasts, and enters large rivers.</p>

<p><i>Fifth Group—Pimelepterina.</i>—In both jaws a single anterior
series of cutting teeth, implanted by a horizontal posterior process,
behind which is a band of villiform teeth.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">[410]</span> Villiform teeth on the
vomer, palatines and the tongue. Vertical fins densely covered with
minute scales. Only one genus is known, <i>Pimelepterus</i>, with six
species from tropical seas. These fishes are sometimes found at a great
distance from the land.</p>


<h6 class="smcap">Fifth Family—Hoplognathidæ.</h6>

<p><i>Body compressed and elevated, covered with very small ctenoid
scales. Lateral line continuous. The bones of the jaws have a sharp
dentigerous edge, as in Scarus. The teeth, if at all conspicuous, being
continuous with the bone, forming a more or less indistinct serrature;
no teeth on the palate. The spinous portion of the dorsal fin is rather
more developed than the soft; the spines strong; anal with three
spines, similar to the soft dorsal. Ventrals thoracic, with one spine
and five soft rays.</i></p>

<p>One genus only is known, <i>Hoplognathus</i>, with four species from
Australian, Japanese, and Peruvian coasts.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="fig176" style="max-width: 303px">

  </div>


<h6 class="smcap">Sixth Family—Cirrhitidæ.</h6>

<p><i>Body oblong, compressed, covered with cycloid scales; lateral
line continuous. Mouth in front of the snout, with lateral cleft.
Eye lateral, of moderate size. Cheeks without a bony stay for the
præoperculum. Generally six, sometimes five or three branchiostegals.
Dentition more or less complete, composed of small pointed teeth,
sometimes with the addition of canines. One dorsal fin, formed by a
spinous and soft portion, of nearly equal development. Anal with three
spines, generally less developed than the soft dorsal. The lower rays
of the pectoral fins simple and generally enlarged; ventrals thoracic,
but remote from the root of the pectorals, with one spine and five
rays.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">[411]</span></p>

<p>The fishes of this family may be readily recognised by their thickened,
undivided lower pectoral rays, which in some are evidently auxiliary
organs of locomotion, in others, probably, organs of touch. They
differ from the following family, the Scorpænidæ, in lacking the
bony connection between the infraorbital ring and the præoperculum.
Two groups may be distinguished in this family, which, however,
are connected by an intermediate genus (<i>Chironemus</i>). The
first, distinguished by the presence of vomerine teeth, consists of
<i>Cirrhites</i> and <i>Chorinemus</i>, small prettily coloured fishes.
The former genus is peculiar to the Indo-Pacific, and consists of
sixteen species; the second, with three species, seems to be confined
to the coasts of Australia and New Zealand. The second group lacks the
vomerine teeth, and comprises the following genera:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Chilodactylus.</span>—One dorsal fin, with from sixteen to
nineteen spines; anal fin of moderate length; caudal forked.
One of the simple pectoral rays more or less prolonged, and
projecting beyond the margin of the fin. Teeth in villiform
bands; no canines. Præoperculum not serrated. Scales of moderate
size. Air-bladder with many lobes.</p>
</div>

  <div class="figcenter" id="fig177" style="max-width: 650px">

     alt="">
     <p class="p0 center smaller">Fig. 177.—<i>Chilodactylus macropterus</i>, from
Australia.</p>
  </div>

<p>Seventeen species are known, chiefly from the temperate parts of the
Southern Pacific, and also from the coasts of Japan and China. They
belong to the most valuable food-fishes, as they grow to a considerable
size (from five to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">[412]</span> twenty-five lbs.), and are easily caught in
numbers. At the Cape of Good Hope they are very abundant, and preserved
in large quantities for export.</p>

<p><i>Mendosoma</i> from the coast of Chili, and <i>Nemadactylus</i> from
Tasmania, are allied genera.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Latris.</span>—Dorsal fin deeply notched; the spinous portion
with seventeen spines; anal fin many-rayed. None of the simple
pectoral rays passes the margin of the fin. Teeth villiform; no
canines. Præoperculum minutely serrated. Scales small.</p>
</div>

<p>Two species only are known from Tasmania and New Zealand, which belong
to the most important food-fishes of the Southern Hemisphere. <i>Latris
hecateia</i> or the “Trumpeter,” ranges from sixty to thirty lbs. in
weight, and is considered by the colonists the best flavoured of any of
the fishes of South Australia, Tasmania, and New Zealand, and consumed
smoked as well as fresh. The second species, <i>Latris ciliaris</i>, is
smaller, scarcely attaining a weight of twenty lbs., but more abundant;
it is confined to the coast of New Zealand.</p>

  </div>


<h6 class="smcap">Seventh Family—Scorpænidæ.</h6>

<p><i>Body oblong, more or less compressed, covered with ordinary scales,
or naked. Cleft of the mouth lateral or subvertical. Dentition feeble,
consisting of villiform teeth; and generally without canines. Some
bones of the head armed, especially the angle of the præoperculum,
its armature receiving additional support by a bony stay, connecting
it with the infraorbital ring. The spinous portion of the dorsal fin
equally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">[413]</span> or more developed than the soft and than the anal. Ventrals
thoracic, generally with one spine and five soft rays, sometimes
rudimentary.</i></p>

<p>This family consists of carnivorous marine fishes only; some
resemble the Sea-Perches in form and habits, as <i>Sebastes</i>,
<i>Scorpæna</i>, etc., whilst others live at the bottom of the sea,
and possess in various degrees of development those skinny appendages
resembling the fronds of seaweeds, by which they either attract
other fishes, or by which they are enabled more effectually to hide
themselves. Species provided with those appendages have generally a
coloration resembling that of their surroundings, and varying with
the change of locality. The habit of living on the bottom has also
developed in many Scorpænoids separate pectoral rays, by means of which
they move or feel. Some of the genera live at a considerable depth, but
apparently not beyond 300 fathoms. Nearly all are distinguished by a
powerful armature either of the head, or fin spines, or both; and in
some the spines have been developed into poison organs.</p>

<p>The only fossil representative known at present is a species of
<i>Scorpæna</i> from the Eocene of Oran.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Sebastes.</span>—Head and body compressed; crown of the head
scaly to, or even beyond, the orbits; no transverse groove on
the occiput. Body covered with scales of moderate or small size,
and without skinny tentacles. Fin-rays not elongate; one dorsal,
divided by a notch into a spinous and soft portion, with twelve
or thirteen spines; the anal with three. No pectoral appendages.
Villiform teeth in the jaws, on the vomer, and generally on the
palatine bones. Vertebræ more than twenty-four.</p>
</div>

<p>About twenty species are known, principally from seas of the temperate
zones, as from the coasts of Northern Europe (<i>S. norvegicus</i>,
<i>S. viviparus</i>), of Japan, California, New Zealand, and Van
Diemen’s Land. All seem to prefer deep water to the surface, and
<i>Sebastes macrochir</i> has been obtained at a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">[414]</span> depth of 345 fathoms.
In their general form they resemble the Sea-Perches, attain to a weight
of from one to four lbs., and are generally esteemed as food.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Scorpæna.</span>—Head large, slightly compressed, generally
with a transverse naked depression on the occiput; bones of the
head armed with spines, and generally with skinny tentacles.
Scales of moderate size. Mouth large, oblique. Villiform teeth
in the jaws, and at least on the vomer. One dorsal, 12–13/9, A.
3/5. Pectoral fins without detached rays, large, rounded, with
the lower rays simple and thickened. Air-bladder none. Vertebræ
twenty-four.</p>

  </div>

<p>About forty species are known from tropical and sub-tropical seas.
They lead a sedentary life, lying hidden in the sand, or between rocks
covered with seaweed, watching for their prey, which chiefly consists
of small fishes. Their strong undivided pectoral rays aid them in
burrowing in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">[415]</span> sand, and in moving along the bottom. The type of
their coloration is very much the same in all the species, viz. an
irregular mottling of red, yellow, brown, and black colours, but the
distribution of these colours varies exceedingly, not only in the same
species but also in the same individuals. They do not attain to any
considerable size, probably never exceeding a length of 18 inches.
Their flesh is well flavoured. Wounds inflicted by their fin-spines are
exceedingly painful, but not followed by serious consequences.</p>

<p><i>Glyptauchen</i> and <i>Lioscorpius</i> are genera closely allied to
<i>Scorpæna</i>, from Australian seas.</p>

<p><i>Setarches</i> is also allied to the preceding genera, and provided
with very large eyes, in accordance with the depth (215 fathoms) which
the two species known at present inhabit; one has been found near
Madeira, the other near the Fiji Islands.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Pterois.</span>—Head and body compressed; scales of small or
moderate size. Bones of the head armed with numerous spinous
projections, between which often skinny tentacles are developed.
The dorsal spines and pectoral rays are more or less prolonged,
passing beyond the margin of the connecting membrane. Twelve or
thirteen dorsal spines. Villiform teeth in the jaws and on the
vomer.</p>
</div>

<p>Nine species are known from the tropical Indo-Pacific. They belong
to the most singularly formed and most beautifully coloured fishes
of the Tropics, and formerly were believed to be able to fly, like
Dactylopterus. But the membrane connecting their pectoral rays is
much too short and feeble to enable them to raise themselves from the
surface of the water.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Apistus.</span>—Head and body compressed, covered with
ctenoid scales of rather small size. Some bones of the head, and
especially the præorbital, are armed with spines. One dorsal
with fifteen spines; the anal with three. The pectoral fin is
elongate, and one ray is completely detached from the fin.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">[416]</span>
Villiform teeth in the jaws, on the vomer, and palatine bones.
Air-bladder present. A cleft behind the fourth gill.</p>
</div>

<p>Two species from the Indian Ocean. These fishes are very small, but
of interest on account of the prolongation of their pectoral fins,
which indicates that they can take long flying leaps out of the water.
However, this requires confirmation by actual observation.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Agriopus.</span>—Head and body compressed, scaleless; head
without any, or with very feeble, armature. Cleft of the mouth
small, at the end of the produced snout. One dorsal fin, which
commences from the head, the spinous portion being formed
by from seventeen to twenty-one strong spines; anal short.
Villiform teeth in the jaws, generally none on the vomer.</p>
</div>

<p>Seven species. This singular genus is peculiar to the temperate parts
of the South Pacific, occurring at the Cape, on the coast of South
Australia, and Chili. The largest species (<i>A. torvus</i>) attains a
length of two and a half feet. Nothing is known of its mode of life.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Synanceia.</span>—General appearance of the fish, especially
of the head, monstrous. Scales none; skin with numerous soft
warty protuberances or filaments. Mouth directed upwards, wide.
Eyes small. From thirteen to sixteen dorsal spines; pectoral
fins very large. Villiform teeth in the jaws, and sometimes on
the vomer.</p>
</div>

<p>Four species are known from the Indo-Pacific, of which <i>S.
horrida</i> and <i>S. verrucosa</i> are the most generally distributed,
and, unfortunately, the most common. They are justly feared on account
of the great danger accompanying wounds which they inflict with their
poisoned dorsal spines, as has been already noticed above, p. 191. The
greatest length to which they attain does not seem to exceed eighteen
inches. They are very voracious fishes, and their stomach is of so
great a capacity that they are able to swallow fishes one-third of
their own bulk.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Micropus.</span>—Head and body strongly compressed, short,
and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">[417]</span> deep; no scales, but the skin is covered with minute
tubercles. Snout very short, with nearly vertical anterior
profile. Præorbital, præ- and inter-operculum with spines on
the edge. Dorsal fin with seven or eight, anal with two spines.
Pectorals short, ventrals rudimentary. Jaws with villiform teeth.</p>
</div>

<p>These fishes belong to the smallest of Acanthopterygians, scarcely
exceeding 1½ inches in length. Two species are known, which are rather
common on the coral reefs of the Pacific.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Chorismodactylus.</span>—Head and body rather compressed,
scaleless, with skinny flaps. Bones of the head with prominent
ridges; the præorbital, præoperculum, and operculum armed; a
depression on the occiput. One dorsal fin, with thirteen spines;
the anal with two. Three free pectoral appendages. Ventral fins
with one spine and five rays. Villiform teeth in the jaws only.</p>
</div>

<p>Only one small species, <i>Ch. multibarbis</i>, is known, from the
coasts of India and China.</p>

<i>Tænianotus</i>, <i>Centropogon</i>, <i>Pentaroge</i>,
<i>Tetraroge</i>, <i>Prosopodasys</i>, <i>Aploactis</i>,
<i>Trichopleura</i>, <i>Hemitripterus</i>, <i>Minous</i> and
<i>Pelor</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">[418]</span></p>


<h6 class="smcap">Eighth Family—Nandidæ.</h6>

<p><i>Body oblong, compressed, covered with scales. Lateral line
interrupted. Dorsal fin formed by a spinous and soft portion, the
number of spines and rays being nearly equal; anal fin with three
spines, and with the soft portion similar to the soft dorsal. Ventral
fins thoracic, with one spine, and five or four rays. Dentition more or
less complete, but feeble.</i></p>

<p>This small family consists of two very distinct groups.</p>

<p>A. <i>Plesiopina.</i> Marine fishes of small size, with pseudobranchiæ
and only four ventral rays. <i>Plesiops</i> from the coral-reefs of the
Indo-Pacific, and <i>Trachinops</i> from the coast of New South Wales,
belong to this group.</p>

<p>B. <i>Nandina.</i> Freshwater fishes of small size from the East
Indies, without pseudobranchiæ, and five ventral rays. The genera are
<i>Badis</i>, <i>Nandus</i>, and <i>Catopra</i>.</p>


<h6 class="smcap">Ninth Family—Polycentridæ.</h6>

<p><i>Body compressed, deep, scaly. Lateral line none. Dorsal and anal
fins long, both with numerous spines, the spinous portion being the
more developed. Ventrals thoracic, with one spine and five soft rays.
Teeth feeble. Pseudobranchiæ hidden.</i></p>

<p>Only two genera, each represented by one or two species in the Atlantic
rivers of Tropical America, <i>Polycentrus</i> and <i>Monocirrhus</i>,
belong to this family. They are small insectivorous fishes.</p>


<h6 class="smcap">Tenth Family—Teuthididæ.</h6>

<p><i>Body oblong, strongly compressed, covered with very small scales.
Lateral line continuous. Eye lateral, of moderate size. A single series
of cutting incisors in each jaw; palate toothless. One dorsal fin,
the spinous portion being the more deve</i><i>loped;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">[419]</span> anal with seven
spines. Ventral fins thoracic, with an outer and an inner spine, and
with three soft rays between.</i></p>

<p>This family consists of one very natural genus, <i>Teuthis</i>, readily
recognised by the singular structure of the fins. In all the species
the fin-formula is D. 13/10. A. 7/9. The incisors are small, narrow,
and provided with a serrated edge. The air-bladder is large, and
forked anteriorly as well as posteriorly. Their skeleton shows several
peculiarities: the number of vertebræ is twenty-three, ten of which
belong to the abdominal portion. The abdominal cavity is surrounded
by a complete ring of bones, the second piece of the coracoid being
exceedingly long, and extending along the whole length of the abdomen,
where it is joined to a spinous process of the first interhæmal. The
pubic bones are slender, long, firmly attached to each other, without
leaving a free space between them. They are fastened by a long process
which passes the symphysis of the radii, and extends on to that of the
humeri.</p>

<p>Thirty species are known, all from the Indo-Pacific; but they do not
extend eastwards beyond 140° long., or to the Sandwich Islands. They
are herbivorous, and do not exceed a length of fifteen inches.</p>


<h5 class="smcap">Second Division—Acanthopterygii Beryciformes.</h5>

<p><i>Body compressed, oblong, or elevated; head with large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">[420]</span> muciferous
cavities which are covered with a thin skin. Ventral fins thoracic,
with one spine and more than five soft rays</i> (<i>in</i> Monocentris
<i>with two only</i>).</p>

<p>One family only belongs to this division.</p>


<h6 class="smcap">Family—Berycidæ.</h6>

<p><i>Body short, with ctenoid scales, which are rarely absent. Eyes
lateral, large</i> (<i>except</i> Melamphaës). <i>Cleft of the mouth
lateral, oblique; jaws with villiform teeth; palate generally toothed.
Opercular bones more or less armed. Eight (four) branchiostegals.</i></p>

<p>This family offers several points of biological interest. All
its members are strictly marine; but only two of the genera are
surface-forms (<i>Holocentrum</i> and <i>Myripristis</i>). All the
others descend considerably below the surface, and even some of the
species of <i>Myripristis</i> habitually inhabit depths of from 50
to 100 fathoms. <i>Polymixia</i> and <i>Beryx</i> have been found in
345 fathoms. <i>Melamphaës</i> must live at a still greater depth,
as we may infer from the small size of its eye; this fish is not
likely to come nearer to the surface than to about 200 fathoms. The
other genera named have extremely large eyes, and, therefore, may be
assumed to ascend into such superficial strata as are still lit up
by a certain proportion of sun-rays. The highly-developed apparatus
for the secretion of superficial mucus, with which these fishes are
provided, is another sign of their living at a greater depth than any
of the preceding families of Acanthopterygians. In accordance with this
vertical distribution, Berycoid fishes have a wide horizontal range,
and several species occur at Madeira as well as in Japan.</p>

<p>Fossil Berycoids show a still greater diversity of form than
living; they belong to the oldest Teleosteous fishes, the majority
of the Acanthopterygians found in the chalk being representatives
of this family. <i>Beryx</i> has been found in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">[421]</span> several species,
with other genera now extinct: <i>Pseudoberyx</i>, with abdominal
ventrals, from Mount Lebanon; <i>Berycopsis</i>, with cycloid
scales; <i>Homonotus</i>, <i>Stenostoma</i>, <i>Sphenocephalus</i>,
<i>Acanus</i>, <i>Hoplopteryx</i>, <i>Platycornus</i>, with granular
scales; <i>Podocys</i>, with a dorsal fin extending to the neck;
<i>Acrogaster</i>, <i>Macrolepis</i>, and <i>Rhacolepis</i>, from the
chalk of Brazil. Species of <i>Holocentrum</i> and <i>Myripristis</i>
occur in the Monte Bolca formation.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Monocentris.</span>—Snout obtuse, convex, short; eye of
moderate size. Villiform teeth on the palatine bones, but none
on the vomer. Opercular bones without armature. Scales very
large, bony, forming a rigid carapace. Ventrals reduced to a
single strong spine and a few rudimentary rays.</p>

<h5 class="smcap">Third Division—Acanthopterygii Kurtiformes.</h5>

<p><i>One dorsal fin only, much shorter than the anal, which is long and
many-rayed. No superbranchial organ.</i></p>

<p>One family only belongs to this division.</p>


<h6 class="smcap">Family—Kurtidæ.</h6>

<p><i>Body compressed, oblong, deep in front, attenuated behind. Snout
short. The spines of the short dorsal are few in number,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">[425]</span> if developed.
Scales small or of moderate size. Villiform teeth in the jaws, on the
vomer, and palatine bones.</i></p>

<p>This family consists of a small number of species only, which form
two distinct genera, <i>Pempheris</i> and <i>Kurtus</i>. They are
shore fishes of tropical seas. In both the air-bladder shows some
peculiarity: in <i>Pempheris</i> it is divided into an anterior and
posterior portion; in <i>Kurtus</i> it is lodged within the ribs,
which are dilated, convex, forming rings. The number of vertebræ is
respectively twenty-four and twenty-three.</p>


<h5 class="smcap">Fourth Division—Acanthopterygii Polynemiformes.</h5>

<p><i>Two rather short dorsal fins, somewhat remote from each other; free
filaments at the humeral arch, below the pectoral fins; muciferous
canals of the head well developed.</i></p>

<p>One family only belongs to this division.</p>


<h6 class="smcap">Family—Polynemidæ.</h6>

<p><i>Body oblong, rather compressed, covered with smooth or very feebly
ciliated scales. Lateral line continuous. Snout projecting beyond the
mouth, which is inferior, with lateral cleft. Eye lateral, large.
Villiform teeth in the jaws and on the palate. Ventrals thoracic, with
one spine and five rays.</i></p>

<p>The fishes of this natural family have been divided, on slight
differences, into three genera—<i>Polynemus</i>, <i>Pentanemus</i>,
and <i>Galeoides</i>. They are found in rather numerous species on the
coasts between the tropics, and the majority enter brackish or even
fresh water. Very characteristic are the free filaments which in this
family are organs of touch; they are inserted on the humeral arch at
some distance from the pectoral fin; but, nevertheless, can be regarded
only as a detached portion of that fin; they can be moved quite
independently of the fin; their number varies from three to fourteen,
according<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">[426]</span> to the species; in some they are exceedingly elongate, twice
as long as the fish, in others they are not longer or even shorter than
the pectoral. It is evident from the whole organisation of these fishes
that they live on muddy bottom or in thick water, such as is found
near the mouths of great rivers. Their eyes are large, but generally
obscured by a filmy skin, so that those feelers must be of great use
to them in finding their way and their food. The Polynemoids are very
useful to man: their flesh is esteemed, and some of the species are
provided with an air-bladder which yields a good sort of isinglass,
and forms an article of trade in the East Indies. Some of these fishes
attain to a length of four feet.</p>

<p>Also this division is composed of one family only.</p>


<h6 class="smcap">Family—Sciænidæ.</h6>

<p><i>Body rather elongate, compressed, covered with ctenoid scales.
Lateral line continuous, and frequently extending over the caudal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">[427]</span> fin.
Mouth in front of the snout. Eye lateral, of moderate size. Teeth in
villiform bands, sometimes with the addition of canines; no molars or
incisor-like teeth in the jaws; palate toothless. Præoperculum unarmed,
and without bony stay. Ventrals thoracic, with one spine and five soft
rays. Bones of the head with wide muciferous channels. Stomach coecal.
Air-bladder frequently with numerous appendages</i> (see pp. 144 and
<i>seq.</i>)</p>

<p>The fishes of the “<i>Meagre</i>” family are chiefly coast-fishes of
the tropical and sub-tropical Atlantic and Indian Oceans, preferring
the neighbourhood of the mouths of large rivers, into which they freely
enter, some of the species having become so completely naturalised in
fresh water that they are never found nowadays in the sea. Some of the
larger species wander far from their original home, and are not rarely
found at distant localities as occasional visitors. In the Pacific
and on the coast of Australia, where but a few large rivers enter the
ocean, they are extremely rare and, in the Red Sea, they are absent.
Many attain a large size, and almost all are eaten.</p>

<p>No fossil species have been as yet discovered.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Pogonias.</span>—Snout convex, with the upper jaw overlapping
the lower. Mandible with numerous small barbels. No canines. The
first dorsal with ten stout spines. Two anal spines, the second
very strong. Scales of moderate size.</p>
</div>

<p>To this fish (<i>P. chromis</i>) more especially is given the name of
“Drum,” from the extraordinary sounds which are produced by it and
other allied Sciænoids. These sounds are better expressed by the word
drumming than by any other, and are frequently noticed by persons in
vessels lying at anchor on the coasts of the United States, where those
fishes abound. It is still a matter of uncertainty by what means the
“Drum” produces the sounds. Some naturalists believe that it is caused
by the clapping together of the pharyngeal teeth, which are very large
molar teeth. However, if it be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">[428]</span> true that the sounds are accompanied
by a tremulous motion of the vessel, it seems more probable that they
are produced by the fishes beating their tails against the bottom of
the vessel in order to get rid of the parasites with which that part
of their body is infested. The “Drum” attains to a length of more than
four feet, and to a weight exceeding a hundred lbs. Its air-bladder has
been figured on p. 146.</p>

<p><i>Micropogon</i> is closely allied to <i>Pogonias</i>, but has conical
pharyngeal teeth. Two species from the western parts of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>Some fifty species are known, but their distinctive characters have
been but imperfectly pointed out. They are found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">[430]</span> in all the seas
and rivers in which Sciænoids generally occur, and many are entirely
confined to fresh water, for instance the species figured, <i>Sciæna
richardsonii</i>, from Lake Huron; <i>Sc. amazonica</i>; <i>Sc.
obliqua</i>, <i>ocellata</i>, <i>oscula</i>, etc., from fresh waters
of the United States. <i>Sciæna diacanthus</i> and <i>Sc. coitor</i>
belong to the most common fishes of the coasts of the East Indies,
ascending the great rivers for a long distance from the sea. One of
the European species, <i>Sciæna aquila</i>, has an extremely wide
range; it not rarely reaches the British coasts, where it is known
as “Meagre,” and has been found at the Cape of Good Hope and on the
coast of southern Australia. Like some of the other species it attains
to a length of six feet, but the majority of the species of this
genus remain within smaller dimensions. A part of the species have
the second anal ray very strong, and have been placed into a distinct
genus, <i>Corvina</i>,—thus, among others, <i>Sc. nigra</i> from the
Mediterranean, and <i>Sc. richardsonii</i>.</p>

<h5 class="smcap">Sixth Division—Acanthopterygii Xiphiiformes.</h5>

<p><i>The upper jaw is produced into a long cuneiform weapon.</i></p>

<p>These fishes form one small family only, <i>Xiphiidæ</i>.</p>

<p>The “Sword-fishes” are pelagic fishes, occurring in all tropical and
sub-tropical seas. Generally found in the open ocean, always vigilant,
and endowed with extraordinary strength and velocity, they are but
rarely captured, and still more rarely preserved. The species found in
the Indian and Pacific Oceans belong to the genus <i>Histiophorus</i>,
distinguished from the common Mediterranean Sword-fish, or
<i>Xiphias</i>, by the presence of ventral fins, which, however, are
reduced to two long styliform appendages. The distinction of the
species is beset with great difficulties, owing to the circumstance
that but few examples exist in museums, and further, because the form
of the dorsal fin, the length of the ventrals, the shape and length of
the sword, appear to change according to the age of the individuals.
Some specimens or species have only the anterior dorsal rays elevated,
the remainder of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">[432]</span> the fin being very low, whilst in others all the
rays are exceedingly elongate, so that the fin, when erected, projects
beyond the surface of the water. It is stated that Sword-fishes, when
quietly floating with the dorsal fin erect, can sail before the wind,
like a boat.</p>

<p>Sword-fishes are the largest of Acanthopterygians, and not exceeded in
size by any other Teleostean; they attain to a length of from 12 to 15
feet, and swords have been obtained more than three feet long, and with
a diameter of at least three inches at the base. The sword is formed by
the prolongation and coalescence of the maxillary and intermaxillary
bones; it is rough at its lower surface, owing to the development
of rudimentary villiform teeth, very hard and strong, and forms a
most formidable weapon. Sword-fishes never hesitate to attack whales
and other large Cetaceans, and by repeatedly stabbing these animals
generally retire from the combat victorious. The cause which excites
them to those attacks is unknown; but they follow this instinct so
blindly that they not rarely attack boats or large vessels in a similar
manner, evidently mistaking them for Cetaceans. Sometimes they actually
succeed in piercing the bottom of a ship, endangering its safety; but
as they are unable to execute powerful backward movements they cannot
always retract their sword, which is broken off by the exertions of the
fish to free itself. A piece of a two-inch plank of a whale-boat, thus
pierced by a sword-fish, in which the broken sword still remains, is
preserved in the British Museum.</p>

<p>The Rev. Wyatt Gill, who has worked as a missionary for many years in
the South Sea Islands, communicates that young Sword-fishes are easily
caught in strong nets, but no net is strong enough to hold a fish of
six feet in length. Specimens of that size are now and then captured
by hook and line, a small fish being used as bait. Individuals with
the sword broken off are not rarely observed. Larger specimens<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">[433]</span> cannot
be captured by the natives, who are in great fear of them. They easily
pierce their canoes, and only too often dangerously wound persons
sitting in them.</p>

<p>The Mediterranean Sword-fish is constantly caught in the nets of the
Tunny-fishers off the coast of Sicily, and brought to market, where its
flesh sells as well as that of the Tunny.</p>

<p>The remarkable changes which Sword-fishes undergo at an early stage of
their growth have been noticed above, p. 173 and <i>seq.</i></p>

<p>Sword-fishes are as old a type as the Berycoids. Their remains have
been found in the chalk of Lewes, and more frequently in the London
clay of Sheppy, where an extinct genus, <i>Coelorhynchus</i>, has been
recognised.</p>


<h5 class="smcap">Seventh Division—Acanthopterygii Trichiuriformes.</h5>

<p><i>Body elongate, compressed or band-like; cleft of the mouth wide,
with several strong teeth in the jaws or on the palate. The spinous
and soft portions of the dorsal fin and the anal are of nearly equal
extent, long, many-rayed, sometimes terminating in finlets; caudal fin
forked, if present.</i></p>


<h6 class="smcap">Family—Trichiuridæ.</h6>

<p>Marine fishes inhabiting the tropical and sub-tropical seas; some of
them are surface-fishes, living in the vicinity of the coast, whilst
others descend to moderate depths, as the Berycoids. All are powerful
rapacious fishes, as is indicated by their dentition.</p>

<p>The oldest of the extinct genera are <i>Enchodus</i> and
<i>Anenchelum</i>; they were formerly referred to the Scombroids,
but belong to this family. The former has been found in the chalk
of Lewes and Mæstricht; the latter is abundant in the Eocene
schists of Glaris. <i>Anenchelum</i> is much elongate, and exhibits
in the slender structure of its bones the characteristics<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">[434]</span> of a
deep-sea fish; it resembles much <i>Lepidopus</i>, but has some long
rays in the ventrals. Other Eocene genera are <i>Nemopteryx</i>
and <i>Xiphopterus</i>. In the Miocene of Licata in Sicily
<i>Trichiuridæ</i> are well represented, viz. by a species of
<i>Lepidopus</i>, and by two genera, <i>Hemithyrsites</i> and
<i>Trichiurichthys</i>, which are allied to <i>Thyrsites</i> and
<i>Trichiurus</i>, but covered with scales.</p>

<p>The following is a complete list of the genera referred to this
family:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Nealotus.</span>—Body incompletely clothed with delicate
scales. Small teeth in the jaws and on the palatine bones;
none on the vomer. Two dorsal fins, the first continuous and
extending to the second; finlets behind the second and anal
fins. Each ventral fin represented by a single small spine. A
dagger-shaped spine behind the vent. Caudal fin well developed.</p>
</div>

<p>One specimen only of this fish (<i>N. tripes</i>), 10 inches long, has
been obtained off Madeira; it evidently lives at a considerable depth,
and comes to the surface only by accident.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Nesiarchus.</span>—Body covered with small scales. Several
strong fangs in the jaws; no teeth on the palate. First dorsal
not extending to the second. No detached finlets. Ventrals
small, but perfectly developed, thoracic. Caudal fin present. A
dagger-shaped spine behind the vent.</p>
</div>

<p>A rather large fish (<i>N. nasutus</i>), very rarely found in the sea
off Madeira. The two or three specimens found hitherto measure from
three to four feet in length. Probably living at the same depth as the
preceding genus.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Aphanopus.</span>—Scales none. Two very long dorsal fins;
caudal well developed; ventrals none. A strong dagger-shaped
spine behind the vent. Strong teeth in the jaws; none on the
palate.</p>
</div>

<p>One species only is known, named <i>A. carbo</i> from its coal-black
colour; it is evidently a deep-sea fish, very rarely obtained in the
sea off Madeira. Upwards of four feet long.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Euoxymetopon.</span>—Body naked, very long and thin.
Profile<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">[435]</span> of the head regularly decurved from the nape to the
snout, the occiput and forehead being elevated and trenchant.
Jaws with fangs; palatine teeth present. One dorsal only,
continued from the head to the caudal fin, which is distinct.
A dagger-shaped spine behind the vent. Pectoral fins inserted
almost horizontally, with the lowest rays longest, and with
the posterior border emarginate. Ventral fins rudimentary,
scale-like.</p>
</div>

<p>This is another deep-sea form of this family, but, at present, no
observations have been made as regards the exact depth at which it
occurs. A specimen has been known since the year 1812; it was found on
the coast of Scotland, and described as <i>Trichiurus lepturus</i>. The
same species has been re-discovered in the West Indies, where, however,
it is also extremely scarce.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Lepidopus.</span>—Body band-like; one single dorsal extends
along the whole length of the back; caudal well developed.
Ventrals reduced to a pair of scales. Scales none. Several fangs
in the jaws; teeth on the palatine bones.</p>
</div>

  <div class="figcenter" id="fig192" style="max-width: 700px">

     <p class="p0 center smaller">Fig. 192.—Lepidopus caudatus.</p>
  </div>

<p>The Scabbard-fish (<i>L. caudatus</i>) is rather common in the
Mediterranean and warmer parts of the Atlantic, extending northwards
to the south coast of England, where it is an occasional visitor, and
southwards to the Cape of Good Hope. More recently it has been observed
on the coasts of Tasmania and New Zealand. We may, therefore, justly
consider it to be a deep-sea fish, which probably descends to the same
depth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">[436]</span> as the preceding allied forms. It grows to a length of five or
six feet, but its body is so much compressed that it does not weigh
more than as many pounds. It is well known in New Zealand, where it is
called “Frost-fish,” and esteemed as the most delicious fish of the
colony. A still more attenuated species (<i>L. tenuis</i>) occurs in
the sea off Japan, at a depth of some 340 fathoms.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Trichiurus.</span>—Body band-like, tapering into a fine
point, without caudal fin. One single dorsal extending the whole
length of the back. Ventrals reduced to a pair of scales, or
entirely absent. Anal fin rudimentary, with numerous extremely
short spines, scarcely projecting beyond the skin. Long fangs in
the jaws; teeth on the palatine bones, none on the vomer.</p>
</div>

<p>The “Hairtails” belong to the tropical marine fauna, and although
generally found in the vicinity of land, they wander frequently out to
sea, perhaps merely because they follow some ocean-currents. Therefore
they are not rarely found in the temperate zone, the common West Indian
species (<i>T. lepturus</i>), for instance, on the coast of England.
They attain to a length of about four feet. The number of their
vertebræ is very large, as many as 160, and more. Six species are known.</p>

</div>

<p>The species of this genus attain to a considerable size (from four
to five feet), and are valuable food fishes; <i>Th. atun</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">[437]</span> from
the Cape of Good Hope, South Australia, New Zealand, and Chili, is
preserved, pickled or smoked. In New Zealand it is called “Barracuda”
or “Snoek,” and exported from the colony into Mauritius and Batavia
as a regular article of commerce, being worth over £17 a ton; <i>Th.
pretiosus</i>, the “Escholar” of the Havannah, from the Mediterranean,
the neighbouring parts of the Atlantic, and the West Indies; <i>Th.

<p>Young specimens of this (or, perhaps, the following) genus have been
described as <i>Dicrotus</i>. In them the finlets are not yet detached
from the rest of the fin; and the ventral fins, which are entirely
obsolete in the adult fish, are represented by a long crenulated spine.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Gempylus.</span>—Body very elongate, scaleless. The first

</div>

<p>One species (<i>G. serpens</i>), inhabiting considerable depths of the
Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.</p>

<h6 class="smcap">Family—Palæorhynchidæ.</h6>

<p>This family has been formed for two extinct genera:
<i>Palæorhynchus</i> from the schists of Glaris, and
<i>Hemirhynchus</i> from tertiary formations near Paris. These genera
resemble much the <i>Trichiuridæ</i> in their long, compressed body,
and long vertical fins, but their jaws, which are produced into a long
beak, are toothless, or provided with very small teeth. The dorsal fin
extends the whole length of the back, and the anal reaches from the
vent nearly to the caudal, which is forked. The ventrals are composed
of several rays and thoracic. The vertebræ long, slender, and numerous,
and, like all the bones of the skeleton, thin, indicating that these
fishes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">[438]</span> were inhabitants of considerable depths of the ocean. Both
the jaws of <i>Palæorhynchus</i> are prolonged into a beak, whilst in
<i>Hemirhynchus</i> the upper exceeds the lower in length.</p>


<h5 class="smcap">Eighth Division—Acanthopterygii Cotto-scombriformes.</h5>

<p><i>Spines developed, in one of the fins at least. Dorsal fins either
continuous or close together; the spinous dorsal, if present, always
short; sometimes modified into tentacles, or into a suctorial disk;
soft dorsal always long, if the spinous is absent; anal similarly
developed as the soft dorsal, and both generally much longer than
the spinous, sometimes terminating in finlets. Ventrals, thoracic or
jugular, if present, never modified into an adhesive apparatus. No
prominent anal papilla.</i></p>

<p>Marine fishes, with few exceptions.</p>


<h6 class="smcap">First Family—Acronuridæ.</h6>

<p><i>Body compressed, oblong or elevated, covered with minute scales.
Tail generally armed with one or more bony plates or spines, which
are developed with age, but absent in very young individuals. Eye
lateral, of moderate size. Mouth small; a single series of more or
less compressed, sometimes denticulated, sometimes pointed incisors in
each jaw; palate toothless. One dorsal fin, the spinous portion being
less developed than the soft; anal with two or three spines; ventral
fins thoracic. Air-bladder forked posteriorly. Intestines with more
or less numerous circumvolutions. Nine abdominal, and thirteen caudal
vertebræ.</i></p>

<p>Inhabitants of the tropical seas, and most abundant on coral-reefs.
They feed either on vegetable substances or on the superficial animal
matter of corals.</p>

<p>Extinct species of <i>Acanthurus</i> and <i>Naseus</i> have been
discovered in the Monte Bolca formation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">[439]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Acanthurus.</span>—Jaws with a single series of lobate
incisors, which are sometimes movable. An erectile spine hidden
in a groove on each side of the tail. Ventral fins with one
spine and generally five rays. Scales ctenoid, sometimes with
minute spines. Branchiostegals five.</p>
</div>

<p>The fishes of this genus, which sometimes are termed “Surgeons,”
are readily recognised by the sharp lancet-shaped spine with which
each side of the tail is armed. When at rest the spine is hidden
in a sheath; but it can be erected and used by the fish as a very
dangerous weapon, by striking with the tail towards the right and
left. “Surgeons” occur in all tropical seas, with the exception of the
eastern part of the Pacific, where they disappear with the corals. They
do not attain to any size, the largest species scarcely exceeding a
length of eighteen inches. Many are agreeably or showily coloured, the
ornamental colours being distributed in very extraordinary patterns.
The larger species are eatable, and some even esteemed as food. It
is stated that the fry of some species periodically approaches, in
immense numbers, the coasts of some of the South Sea Islands (Caroline
Archipelago), and serves as an important article of food to the
natives. Nearly fifty species are known.</p>

  </div>

<p>At an early period of their growth these fishes present so different an
aspect that they were considered a distinct genus, <i>Acronurus</i>.
The form of the body is more circular and exceedingly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">[440]</span> compressed. No
scales are developed, but the skin forms numerous oblique parallel
folds. The gill-cover and the breast are shining silvery.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Naseus.</span>—Tail with two (rarely one or three) bony
keeled plates on each side (in the adult). Head sometimes with
a bony horn or crest-like prominence directed forwards. Ventral
fins composed of one spine and three rays. From four to six
spines in the dorsal; two anal spines. Scales minute, rough,
forming a sort of fine shagreen. Air-bladder forked behind.
Intestinal tract with many circumvolutions.</p>
</div>

<p>Twelve species are known from the tropical Indo-Pacific, but none of
them extend eastwards beyond the Sandwich Islands. In their mode of
life these fishes resemble the <i>Acanthuri</i>. Likewise, the young
have a very different appearance, and are unarmed, and were described
as a distinct genus, <i>Keris</i>. One of the most common species is
<i>N. unicornis</i>, which, when adult (22 inches long), has a horn
about 2 inches long, whilst it is merely a projection in front of the
eye in individuals of 7 inches in length.</p>

<p><i>Prionurus</i> is an allied genus with a series of several keeled
bony laminæ on each side of the tail.</p>

<p>Inhabitants of tropical and temperate seas. Carnivorous. They
appear first in cretaceous formations, where they are represented
by <i>Platax</i> and some Caranx-like genera (<i>Vomer</i> and
<i>Aipichthys</i> from the chalk of Comen in Istria). They
are more numerous in various Tertiary formations, especially
in the strata of Monte Bolca, where some still existing
genera<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">[442]</span> occur, as <i>Zanclus</i>, <i>Platax</i>, <i>Caranx</i>
(<i>Carangopsis</i>), <i>Argyriosus</i> (<i>Vomer</i>), <i>Lichia</i>,
<i>Trachynotus</i>. Of the extinct genera the following belong to
this family:—<i>Pseudovomer</i> (<i>Licata</i>), <i>Amphistium</i>,
<i>Archæus</i>, <i>Ductor</i>, <i>Plionemus</i> (?), and
<i>Semiophorus</i>. <i>Equula</i> has been recently discovered in the
Miocene marls of Licata in Sicily.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Caranx</span> (including <i>Trachurus</i>).—Body more or

anal are succeeded by finlets in a few species. Two anal spines,
somewhat remote from the fin. Scales very small. Lateral line
with an anterior curved, and a posterior straight, portion,
either entirely or posteriorly only covered by large plate-like
scales, several of which are generally keeled, the keel ending

<p>The “Horse-mackerels” are found in abundance in almost all temperate
and, especially, tropical seas. Many species wander to other parts
of the coast, or to some distance from land, and have thus gradually
extended their range over two or more oceanic areas; some are found
in all tropical seas. The species described are very numerous, about
ninety having been properly characterised and distinguished. Some
attain to a length of three feet and more, and all are eatable. They
feed on other fish and various marine animals.</p>

<p>Of the most noteworthy species the following may be mentioned:—<i>C.
trachurus</i>, the common British Horse-mackerel, distinguished
by having the lateral line in its whole length armed with large
vertical plates; it is almost cosmopolitan within the temperate and
tropical zones of the northern and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">[443]</span> southern hemispheres. <i>C.
crumenophthalmus</i>, <i>C. carangus</i>, and <i>C. hippos</i>, three
of the most common sea-fishes, equally abundant in the Atlantic
and Indo-Pacific oceans; <i>C. ferdau</i>, from the Indo-Pacific,
upwards of three feet in length. <i>C. armatus</i>, <i>ciliaris</i>,
<i>gallus</i>, etc., which have an exceedingly short and compressed
body, with rudimentary spinous dorsal fin, and with some of the rays of
the dorsal and anal prolonged into filaments.</p>

<p>Two species from the tropical Atlantic.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Micropteryx.</span>—Body much compressed, with prominent

<p>These fishes are often called “Yellow-tails,” and occur in nearly
all the temperate and tropical seas, sometimes at a great distance
from land. Twelve species are known, and the majority have a wide
geographical range. The larger grow to a length of from four to five
feet, and are esteemed as food, especially at St. Helena, the Cape of
Good Hope, in Japan, Australia, and New Zealand.</p>

<p><i>Seriolella</i> and <i>Seriolichthys</i>, the latter from the

</div>

<p>The “Pilot-fish” (<i>N. ductor</i>) is a truly pelagic fish, known in
all tropical and temperate seas. Its name is derived from its habit of
keeping company with ships and large fish, especially Sharks. It is the
<i>Pompilus</i> of the ancients, who describe it as pointing out the
way to dubious or embarrassed sailors, and as announcing the vicinity
of land by its sudden disappearance. It was therefore regarded as a
sacred fish. The connection between the Shark and the Pilot-fish has
received various interpretations, some observers having perhaps added
more sentiment than is warranted by the actual facts. It was stated
that the Shark never seized the Pilot-fish, that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">[445]</span> latter was of
great use to its big companion in conducting it and showing it the way
to its food. Dr. Meyen in his “Reise um die Erde” states: “The pilot
swims constantly in front of the Shark; we ourselves have seen three
instances in which the Shark was led by the Pilot. When the Shark
neared the ship the Pilot swam close to the snout, or near one of the
pectoral fins of the animal. Sometimes he darted rapidly forwards or
sidewards as if looking for something, and constantly went back again
to the Shark. When we threw overboard a piece of bacon fastened on a
great hook, the Shark was about twenty paces from the ship. With the
quickness of lightning the Pilot came up, smelt at the dainty, and
instantly swam back again to the Shark, swimming many times round his
snout and splashing, as if to give him exact information as to the
bacon. The Shark now began to put himself in motion, the Pilot showing
him the way, and in a moment he was fast upon the hook.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Upon a
later occasion we observed two Pilots in sedulous attendance on a Blue
Shark, which we caught in the Chinese Sea. It seems probable that the
Pilot feeds on the Sharks’ excrements, keeps his company for that
purpose, and directs his operations solely from this selfish view.” We
believe that Dr. Meyen’s opinion, as expressed in his last words, is
perfectly correct. The Pilot obtains a great part of his food directly
from the Shark, in feeding on the parasitic crustaceans with which
Sharks and other large fish are infested, and on the smaller pieces of
flesh which are left unnoticed by the Shark when it tears its prey.
The Pilot also, being a small fish, obtains greater security when in
company of a Shark, which would keep at a distance all other fishes of
prey that would be likely to prove dangerous to the Pilot. Therefore,
in accompanying the Shark, the Pilot is led by the same instinct which
makes it follow a ship.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">[446]</span> With regard to the statement that the Pilot
itself is never attacked by the Shark all observers agree as to its
truth; but this may be accounted for in the same way as the impunity
of the swallow from the hawk, the Pilot-fish being too nimble for the
unwieldy Shark.</p>

<p>The Pilot-fish does not always leave the vessels on their approach
to land. In summer, when the temperature of the sea-water is several
degrees above the average, Pilots will follow ships to the south
coast of England into the harbour, where they are generally speedily
caught. Pilot-fish attain a length of 12 inches only. When very young
their appearance differs so much from the mature fish that they have
been described as a distinct genus, <i>Nauclerus</i>. This fry is
exceedingly common in the open ocean, and constantly obtained in the
tow-net; therefore the Pilot-fish retains its pelagic habits also
during the spawning season, and some of the spawn found by voyagers
floating on the surface is, without doubt, derived from this species.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Chorinemus.</span>—Body compressed, oblong; covered with
small scales, singularly shaped, lanceolate, and hidden in
the skin. The first dorsal is formed by free spines in small
numbers; the posterior rays of the second dorsal and anal are
detached finlets. Small teeth in the jaws, on the vomer and
palatine bones.</p>
</div>

<p>Twelve species are known from the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific; some enter
brackish water, whilst others are more numerous at some distance from
the shore. They attain to a length of from 2 to 4 feet. In the young,
which have been described as <i>Porthmeus</i>, the spines and finlets
are connected by membrane with the rest of the fin.</p>

<p><i>Lichia</i> is an allied genus from the Mediterranean, tropical
Atlantic, and the coast of Chili; five species.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Temnodon.</span>—Body oblong, compressed, covered with
cycloid scales of moderate size. Cleft of the mouth rather wide.

spines connected by membrane; finlets none. Lateral line not
shielded. The second dorsal and anal covered with very small
scales.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Temnodon saltator</i>, sometimes called “Skip-jack,” is spread over
nearly all the tropical and sub-tropical seas; it frequents principally
the coasts, but is also met with in the open sea. On the coasts of the
United States it is well known by the name of “Blue-fish,” being highly
esteemed as food, and furnishing excellent sport. It is one of the most
rapacious fishes, destroying an immense number of other shore-fishes,
and killing many more than they can devour. It grows to a length of 5
feet, but the majority of those brought to market are not half that
length.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Trachynotus.</span>—Body more or less elevated, compressed,
covered with very small scales. Cleft of the mouth rather small,
with short convex snout. Opercles entire. The first dorsal
composed of free spines in small number. No finlets. Teeth
always small, and generally lost with age.</p>
</div>

<p>Ten species are known from the tropical Atlantic and Indo-Pacific; they
rarely exceed a length of 20 inches. Some of the most common marine
fishes belong to this genus, for instance <i>T. ovatus</i>, which
ranges over the entire tropical zone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pammelas</span> (<i>perciformis</i>) is allied to the preceding

<p>These fishes are called “Sea-bats,” from the extraordinary length of
some portion of their dorsal and anal fins and of their ventrals. These
long lobes are generally of a deep black colour. In mature and old
individuals the fin-rays are much shorter than in the young, which have
been described as distinct species. There are probably not more than
seven species of “Sea-bats,” if so many, and they all belong to the

<p>“John Dorys” are found in the Mediterranean, on the eastern temperate
shores of the Atlantic, on the coasts of Japan and Australia. Six
species are known, all of which are highly esteemed for the table. The
English name given to one of the European species (<i>Zeus faber</i>)
seems to be partly a corruption of the Gascon “Jau,” which signifies
cock, “Dory” being derived from the French Dorée, so that the entire
name means Gilt-Cock. Indeed, in some other localities of Southern
Europe it bears the name of <i>Gallo</i>. The same species occurs also
on the coasts of South Australia and New Zealand. The fishermen of
Roman Catholic countries hold this fish in special respect, as they
recognise in a black round spot on its side the mark left by the thumb
of St. Peter when he took the piece of money from its mouth.</p>

<p>Three species are known from Madeira, South Australia, and New Zealand.</p>


<h6 class="smcap">Fourth Family—Stromateidæ.</h6>

<p><i>Body more or less oblong and compressed, covered with very small
scales; eye lateral. Dentition very feeble; œsophagus armed with
numerous horny, barbed processes. No bony stay for the præoperculum.
Dorsal fin single, long, without distinct spinous division. More than
ten abdominal and more than fourteen caudal vertebræ.</i></p>

<p>This small family consists of strictly marine and partly
pelagic species referred to two genera, <i>Stromateus</i> and
<i>Centrolophus</i>. The former lacks ventral fins, at least in the
adult stage, and is represented by about ten species in almost all the
tropical and warmer seas. <i>Centrolophus</i>, hitherto known from two
or three European species only (of which one occasionally reaches the
south coast of England, where it is named “Black-fish”), has recently
been discovered on the coast of Peru, and has probably a much wider
range.</p>


<h6 class="smcap">Fifth Family—Coryphænidæ.</h6>

<p><i>Body compressed; eye lateral. Teeth small, conical, if present;
œsophagus smooth. No bony stay for the præoperculum. Dorsal fin single,
long, without distinct spinous division. More than ten abdominal and
more than fourteen caudal vertebræ.</i></p>

<p>All the members of this family have pelagic habits. Representatives
of it have been recognized in some fossil remains: thus
<i>Goniognathus</i> from the Isle of Sheppey, and the living genus
<i>Mene</i> (<i>Gastrocnemus</i>) at Monte Bolca.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Coryphæna.</span>—Body compressed, rather elongate; adult
specimens with a high crest on the top of the head; cleft of
the mouth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">[453]</span> wide. A single dorsal extending from the occiput
almost to the caudal, which is deeply forked; no distinct
dorsal and anal spines. The ventrals are well developed, and
can be received in a groove on the abdomen. Scales very small.
Rasp-like teeth in the jaws, on the vomer and the palatine
bones. Air-bladder absent.</p>

  </div>

<p>Generally, though by misapplication of the name, called “Dolphins.”
About six species are known, each of which is probably distributed
over all the tropical and sub-tropical seas. Strictly pelagic in their
habits, they are most powerful swimmers; they congregate in shoals,
and pursue unceasingly the Flying-Fish, which try to escape their
enemies by long flying leaps. They attain to a length of six feet,
and are eagerly caught by sailors on account of their well-flavoured
flesh. The beauty of their, unfortunately fugitive, colours has ever
been a subject of admiration. As far as the colours are capable of
description, those of the common species (<i>C. hippurus</i>), which is
often seen in the Mediterranean, are silvery blue above, with markings
of a deeper azure, and reflections of pure gold, the lower parts being
lemon-yellow, marked with pale blue. The pectoral fins are partly lead
colour, partly yellow; the anal is yellow, the iris of the eye golden.
These iridescent colours change rapidly whilst the fish is dying, as in
the Mackerel. The form of the body, and especially of the head, changes
considerably with age. Very young specimens, from one to six inches
in length, are abundant in the open sea, and frequently obtained in
the tow-net. Their body is cylindrical, their head as broad as high,
and the eye relatively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">[454]</span> very large, much longer than the snout. As the
fish grows the body is more compressed, and finally a high crest is
developed on the head, and the anterior part of the dorsal fin attains
a height equal to that of the body.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Brama.</span>—Body compressed, and more or less elevated,
covered with rather small scales; cleft of the mouth very
oblique, with the lower jaw longest. Dorsal and anal fins
many-rayed, the former with three or four, the latter with two
or three, spines; caudal deeply forked. Ventrals thoracic,
with one spine and five rays. The jaws with an outer series of
stronger teeth.</p>
</div>

<p>Pelagic fishes which, like the allied genus <i>Taractes</i>, range over
almost all the tropical and temperate seas.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Lampris.</span>—Body compressed and elevated, covered with
very small deciduous scales; cleft of the mouth narrow. A single
dorsal, without a spinous portion. Ventrals composed of numerous
rays. Teeth none.</p>
</div>

     <p class="p0 center smaller">Fig. 203.—Lampris luna.</p>
  </div>

<p>The “Sun-fish” (<i>L. luna</i>) is one of the most beautiful fishes of
the Atlantic. It attains to the large size of four feet in length, is
bluish on the back, with round silvery spots, which colour prevails
on the lower parts; the fins are of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">[455]</span> deep scarlet. It is said to be
excellent eating. It is a pelagic fish, not rare about Madeira, but
extending far northwards in the Atlantic; it seems to be rarer in the
Mediterranean. All the specimens hitherto obtained were full-grown
or nearly so. The skeleton exhibits several peculiarities, viz. an
extraordinary development and dilatation of the humeral arch, and great
strength of the numerous and closely-set ribs.</p>

<p>Other Coryphænoid genera are <i>Pteraclis</i>, <i>Schedophilus</i>,
<i>Diana</i>, <i>Ausonia</i>, and <i>Mene</i>; all pelagic forms.</p>


<h6 class="smcap">Sixth Family—Nomeidæ.</h6>

<p><i>Body oblong, more or less compressed, covered with cycloid scales of
moderate size; eye lateral. No bony stay for the præoperculum. Dorsal
fin with a distinct spinous portion separated from the soft; sometimes
finlets; caudal forked. More than ten abdominal, and more than fourteen
caudal vertebræ.</i></p>

<p>Marine fishes; pelagic, at least when young.</p>

<p><i>N. gronovii</i> is a common pelagic fish in the Atlantic and Indian
Oceans; of small size.</p>

<p>Other genera belonging to this family are <i>Psenes</i> and
<i>Cubiceps</i>.</p>


<h6 class="smcap">Seventh Family—Scombridæ.</h6>

<p><i>Body oblong, scarcely compressed, naked or covered with small
scales; eye lateral. Dentition well developed. No bony stay for the
præoperculum. Two dorsal fins; generally finlets. Ventrals thoracic,
with one spine and five rays. More than ten abdominal, and more than
fourteen caudal vertebræ.</i></p>

<p>The fishes of the “Mackerel” family are pelagic forms, abundant in all
the seas of the tropical and temperate zones. They are one of the four
families of fishes which are the most useful to man, the others being
the Gadoids, Clupeoids, and Salmonoids. They are fishes of prey, and
unceasingly active, their power of endurance in swimming being equal
to the rapidity of their motions. Their muscles receive a greater
supply of blood-vessels and nerves than in other fishes, and are of a
red colour, and more like those of birds or mammals. This energy of
muscular action causes the temperature of their blood to be several
degrees higher than in other fishes. They wander about in shoals, spawn
in the open sea, but periodically approach the shore, probably in the
pursuit of other fishes on which they feed.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">[457]</span></p>

<p><i>Scombridæ</i> are well represented in tertiary formations: in the
Eocene schists of Glaris two extinct genera, <i>Palimphyes</i> and
<i>Isurus</i>, have been discovered. In Eocene and Miocene formations
<i>Scomber</i>, <i>Thynnus</i>, and <i>Cybium</i> are not uncommon.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Scomber.</span>—The first dorsal continuous, with feeble
spines; five or six finlets behind the dorsal and anal. Scales
very small, and equally covering the whole body. Teeth small.
Two short ridges on each side of the caudal fin.</p>
</div>

<p>Mackerels proper are found in almost all temperate and tropical seas,
with the exception of the Atlantic shores of temperate South America,
where they have not been found hitherto. In Europe, and probably also
on the coast of England, three species occur: <i>S. scomber</i>, the
common Mackerel, which lacks an air-bladder; <i>S. pneumatophorus</i>,
a more southern species, with an air-bladder; and <i>S. colias</i>,
like the former, but with a somewhat different coloration, and often
called “Spanish” Mackerel. On the Cape of Good Hope, in Japan, on the
coast of California, in South Australia, and New Zealand, Mackerels
are abundant, which are either identical with, or very closely allied
to, the European species. On the coasts of the United States the
same species occur which tenant the western parts of the Atlantic.
Altogether seven species are known.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="fig205" style="max-width: 750px">

     <p class="p0 center smaller">Fig. 205.—Thynnus thynnus.</p>
  </div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Thynnus.</span>—The first dorsal continuous, with the spines
rather feeble; from six to nine finlets behind the dorsal and
anal.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">[458]</span> Scales of the pectoral region crowded, forming a corslet.
Teeth rather small. A longitudinal keel on each side of the tail.</p>
</div>

<p>The best-known species of this genus is the “Tunny” (<i>Thynnus
thynnus</i>), abundant in the Mediterranean, and ranging to the south
coast of England and to Tasmania. It is one of the largest fishes of
the ocean, attaining to a length of 10 feet, and to a weight of more
than 1000 lbs. The fishery of the Tunny is systematically carried on in
the Mediterranean, and dates from the most remote antiquity. Its salted
preparation was esteemed by the Romans under the name of <i>Saltamentum
sardicum</i>. Its flesh is extensively eaten now, fresh as well as
preserved.</p>

<p><i>Thynnus pelamys</i>, or the “Bonito,” is equally well known, and
ranges over all the tropical and temperate seas; it eagerly pursues the
Flying-fish, and affords welcome sport and food to the sailor. In its
form it resembles the Tunny, but is more slender and rarely above three
feet long.</p>

<p>Some of the other species are provided with very long pectoral fins,
and generally called by sailors “Albacore.” They are said to grow to a
length of six feet; Bennett in his “Whaling Voyage,” vol. ii. p. 278,
makes the following observations on <i>Th. germo</i>, from the Pacific:
“Ships when cruising slowly in the Pacific Ocean, are usually attended
by myriads of this fish for many successive months. A few days’ rapid
sailing is, nevertheless, sufficient to get rid of them, however
numerous they may be, for they seldom pay more than very transient
visits to vessels making a quick passage. When the ship is sailing with
a fresh breeze they swim pertinaciously by her side and take the hook
greedily, but should she be lying motionless or becalmed they go off
to some distance in search of prey, and cannot be prevailed upon to
take the most tempting bait the sailor can devise. It is probably as a
protection from their chief enemy, the Sword-fish, that they seek the
society of a ship. I am not aware that the Shark is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">[459]</span> also their enemy;
but they seemed to have an instinctive dread of this large fish, and
when it approached the ship, would follow it in shoals, and annoy it in
the same manner as the smaller birds may be seen to annoy those of a
larger and predaceous kind, as the hawk or owl. They are very voracious
and miscellaneous feeders. Flying-fish, Calmars, and small shoal-fish
are their most natural food; though they do not refuse the animal
offal from a ship. Amongst the other food contained in their maw, we
have found small Ostracions, File-fish, Sucking-fish, Janthina shells,
and pelagic crabs; in one instance a small Bonita, and in a second a
Dolphin eight inches long, and a Paper-nautilus shell containing its
sepia-tenant. It was often amusing to watch an Albacore pursuing a
Flying-fish, and to mark the precision with which it swam beneath the
feeble æronaut, keeping him steadily in view, and preparing to seize
him at the moment of his descent. But this the Flying-fish would often
elude by instantaneously renewing his leap, and not unfrequently escape
by extreme agility.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Pelamys.</span>—The first dorsal continuous, with the spines
rather feeble; from seven to nine finlets behind the dorsal and
anal. Scales of the pectoral region forming a corslet. Teeth

<p>Five species are known, of which <i>P. sarda</i> is common in the
Atlantic and Mediterranean.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Auxis.</span>—Differing from the preceding two genera in

<p>Twelve species from the tropical Atlantic and Indian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">[460]</span> Ocean;
frequenting more the coast-region than the open sea; attaining to a
length of four or five feet.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Elacate.</span>—Body covered with very small scales; head
depressed; cleft of the mouth moderately wide; no keel on the
tail. The spinous dorsal is formed by eight small free spines;
finlets none. Villiform teeth in the jaws, on the vomer and the
palatine bones.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Elacate nigra</i>, a coast fish common in the warmer parts of the
Atlantic and the Indian Ocean.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Echeneis.</span>—The spinous dorsal fin is modified into an
adhesive disk, occupying the upper side of the head and neck.</p>
</div>

<p>This genus is closely allied to the preceding, from which it differs
only by the transformation of the spinous dorsal fin into a sucking
organ. The spines being composed of two halves, each half is bent down
towards the right and the left, forming a support to a double series of
transverse lamellæ, rough on their edges, the whole disk being of an
oval shape and surrounded by a membranous fringe. Each pair of lamellæ
is formed out of one spine, which, as usual, is supported at the base
by an interneural spine. By means of this disk the “Sucking-fishes”
or “Suckers” are enabled to attach themselves to any flat surface,
a series of vacuums being created by the erection of the usually
recumbent lamellæ. The adhesion is so strong that the fish can only be
dislodged with difficulty, unless it is pushed forward by a sliding
motion. The Suckers attach themselves to sharks, turtles, ships, or any
other object which serves their purpose. They cannot be regarded as
parasites, inasmuch as they obtain their food independently of their
host. Being bad swimmers they allow themselves to be carried about by
other animals or vessels endowed with a greater power of locomotion.
They were as well known to the ancients as they are to the modern
navigators. Aristotle and Aelian mention the Sucker under the name of
φθεὶρ, or the <i>Louse</i>; “In the sea<span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">[461]</span> between Cyrene and Egypt there
is a fish about the Dolphin (<i>Delphinus</i>), which they call the
Louse; this becomes the fattest of all fishes, because it partakes of
the plentiful supply of food captured by the Dolphin.” Later writers,
then, repeat a story, the source of which is unknown, viz. that the
“Remora” is able to arrest vessels in their course, a story which has
been handed down to our own time. It need not be stated that this is an
invention, though it cannot be denied that the attachment of one of the
larger species may retard the progress of a sailing vessel, especially
when, as is sometimes the case, several individuals accompany the same
ship. An account of a somewhat ingenious way of catching sleeping
turtles by means of a Sucking-fish held by a ring fastened round its
tail, appears to have originated rather from an experiment than from
regular practice.</p>

<p>Ten different species are known, of which <i>Echeneis remora</i> and
<i>Echeneis naucrates</i> are the most common. The former is short
and grows to a length of eight inches only, the latter is a slender
fish, not rarely found three feet long. The bulkiest is <i>Echeneis
scutata</i>, which attains to a length of two feet; individuals of that
size weighing about eight lbs.</p>

<p>The number of pairs of lamellæ varies in the various species, from 12
to 27. The caudal fin of some of the species undergoes great changes
with age. In young specimens the middle portion of the fin is produced
into a long filiform lobe. This lobe becomes gradually shorter, and the
fin shows a rounded margin in individuals of middle age. When the fish
approaches the mature state, the upper and lower lobes are produced,
and the fin becomes subcrescentic or forked.</p>

<h6 class="smcap">Eighth Family.—Trachinidæ.</h6>

<p><i>Body elongate, low, naked or covered with scales. Teeth small,
conical. No bony stay for the præoperculum. One or two dorsal fins,
the spinous portion being always shorter and much less developed than
the soft; the anal similarly developed as the soft dorsal; no finlets.
Ventrals with one spine and five rays. Gill-opening more or less
wide. Ten or more than ten abdominal, and more than fourteen caudal
vertebræ.</i></p>

<p>Carnivorous coast-fishes of small size, found in every quarter of the
globe, but scarcely represented in the Arctic zone (<i>Trichodon</i>);
on the other hand, they are rather numerous towards the Antarctic
circle. All are bad swimmers, generally moving along the bottom in
small depths. Only one genus (<i>Bathydraco</i>) is known from the
deep-sea.</p>

<p>A genus which shows the principal characters of this family
(<i>Callipteryx</i>), has been found in the tertiary deposits of Monte
Bolca; it is scaleless. A second genus, <i>Trachinopsis</i>, has been
recently described by Sauvage from the Upper Tertiary of Lorca in
Spain; and a third (<i>Pseudoeleginus</i>) from the Miocene of Licata.</p>

<p>This family may be subdivided into five groups:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. In the <span class="smcap">Uranoscopina</span> the eyes are on the upper
surface of the head, directed upwards; the lateral line is
continuous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uranoscopus.</span>—Head large, broad, thick, partly covered
with bony plates; cleft of the mouth vertical. Scales very
small. Two dorsal fins, the first with from three to five
spines; ventrals jugular; pectoral rays branched. Villiform
teeth in the jaws, on the vomer and palatine bones; no canines.
Generally a long filament below and before the tongue.
Gill-cover armed.</p>
</div>

<p>The position of the eyes on the upper surface of the head, which these
fishes have in common with many others, is well expressed by the name
<i>Uranoscopus</i> (Stare-gazer). Their eyes are very small, and can be
raised or depressed at the will of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">[463]</span> the fish. They are inactive fishes,
generally lying hidden at the bottom between stones, watching for their
prey. The delicate filament attached to the bottom of their mouth, and
playing in front of it in the current of water which passes through the
mouth, serves to lure small animals within reach of the fish. Eleven
species are known from the Indo-Pacific and Atlantic, and one (<i>U.
scaber</i>) from the Mediterranean; they attain rarely a length of
twelve inches.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Leptoscopus.</span>—Form of the head as in
<i>Uranoscopus</i>, but entirely covered with a thin skin.
Scales small, cycloid. One continuous dorsal; ventrals jugular;
pectoral rays branched. Villiform teeth in both jaws, on the
vomer and palatine bones; canines none. No oral filament.
Gill-cover unarmed.</p>

of North America; <i>Anema</i> from the Indian Ocean and New Zealand;
and <i>Kathetostoma</i> from Australia and New Zealand.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>2. In the <span class="smcap">Trachinina</span> the eyes are more or less lateral;
the lateral line is continuous; and the intermaxillary without a
larger tooth on its posterior portion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trachinus.</span>—Cleft of the mouth very oblique; eye
lateral, but directed upwards. Scales very small, cycloid. Two
dorsal fins, the first short, with six or seven spines; ventrals
jugular; the lower pectoral rays simple. Villiform teeth in
the jaws, on the vomer and palatine bones. Præorbital and
præoperculum armed.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">[464]</span></p>

<p>The “Weevers” are common fishes on the European coasts, and but too
well known to all fishermen; singularly enough they do not extend
across the Atlantic to the American coast, but reappear on the coast of
Chili! Wounds by their dorsal and opercular spines are much dreaded,
being extremely painful, and sometimes causing violent inflammation
of the wounded part. No special poison-organ has been found in these
fishes, but there is no doubt that the mucous secretion in the vicinity
of the spines has poisonous properties. The dorsal spines as well as
the opercular spine have a deep double groove in which the poisonous
fluid is lodged, and by which it is inoculated in the punctured wound.
On the British coasts two species occur, <i>T. draco</i>, the Greater
Weever, attaining to a length of twelve inches, and <i>T. vipera</i>,
the Lesser Weever, which grows only to half that size.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Champsodon.</span>—Body covered with minute granular scales;
lateral lines two, with numerous vertical branches. Cleft of
the mouth wide, oblique. Eye lateral, but directed upwards.

Teeth in the jaws in a single series, thin, long, of unequal
size. Teeth on the vomer, none on the palate. Gill-openings
exceedingly wide. Præoperculum with a spine at the angle and a
fine serrature on the posterior margin.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Champsodon vorax</i> is not uncommon at small depths off the
Philippine Islands, Admiralty Islands, and in the Arafura Sea.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Percis.</span>—Body cylindrical, with small ctenoid scales;

<p>Two genera, <i>Pinguipes</i> and <i>Latilus</i>, from various parts of
tropical and sub-tropical seas, belong to this group.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>4. In the <span class="smcap">Pseudochromides</span>, the lateral line is

<h6 class="smcap">Tenth Family—Batrachidæ.</h6>

<p><i>Head broad and thick; body elongate, compressed behind; skin naked
or with small scales. No bony stay for the præoperculum. Teeth conical,
small or of moderate size. The spinous dorsal consists of two or three
spines only; the soft and the anal long. Ventrals jugular, with two
soft rays; pectorals not pediculated. Gill-opening a more or less
vertical slit before the pectoral, rather narrow.</i></p>

<p>Carnivorous fishes, of small size, living on the bottom of the sea near
the coast in the tropical zone, some species advancing into the warmer
parts of the temperate zones.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Batrachus.</span>—The spinous dorsal is formed by three stout
spines. Gill-covers armed with spines. Circumference of the

skinny tentacles.</p>
</div>

<p>Some of the fishes of this genus possess a subcutaneous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_468">[468]</span> spacious
cavity behind the base of the pectoral fin, the inside of which is
coated with a reticulated mucous membrane. It opens by a foramen in
the upper part of the axil.—This apparatus is the same which is found
in many Siluroid fishes, and which has been noticed above, p. 192.
There cannot be any doubt that it is a secretory organ, but whether
the secretion has any poisonous properties, as in the Siluroids, or
as in <i>Thalassophryne</i>, has not been determined. No instance of
poisonous wounds having been inflicted by these fishes is on record.
Twelve species are known, the distribution of which coincides with that
of the family; one very fine species, <i>B. didactylus</i>, occurs in
the Mediterranean.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Thalassophryne.</span>—The spinous dorsal is formed by two

<h6 class="smcap">Eleventh Family—Psychrolutidæ.</h6>

<p><i>Body rather elongate, naked; head broad. Spinous dorsal separate or
absent. Ventral fins close together, thoracic, composed of a few rays.
Teeth small. Three gills and a half; pseudobranchiæ well developed;
gill-openings of moderate width, the gill-membranes being attached to
the isthmus.</i></p>

<p>Of this family only two representatives are known, viz. <i>Psychrolutes
paradoxus</i>, from Vancouver’s Islands, without first dorsal fin; and
<i>Neophrynichthys latus</i>, from New Zealand, with two dorsal fins.
Both are very scarce marine fishes.</p>


<h6 class="smcap">Twelfth Family—Pediculati.</h6>

<p><i>Head and anterior part of the body very large, without scales. No
bony stay for the præoperculum. Teeth villiform or rasp-like. The
spinous dorsal is advanced forwards, composed of a few more or less
isolated spines, often transformed into tentacles; or entirely absent.
Ventral fins jugular, with four or five soft rays, sometimes absent.
The carpal bones are prolonged, forming a sort of arm, terminating in
the pectoral. Gill-opening reduced to a small foramen, situated in or
near the axil. Gills two and a half, or three, or three and a half;
pseudobranchiæ generally absent.</i></p>

<p>This family contains a larger number of bizarre forms than any other;
and there is, perhaps, none in which the singular organisation of the
fish is more distinctly seen to be in consonance with its habits.
Pediculates are found in all seas. The habits of all are equally
sluggish and inactive; they are very bad swimmers; those found near the
coasts lie on the bottom of the sea, holding on with their arm-like
pectoral fins by seaweed or stones, between which they are hidden;
those of pelagic habits attach themselves to floating seaweed or
other objects, and are at the mercy of wind and current. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_470">[470]</span> large
proportion of the genera, therefore, have gradually found their way to
the greatest depths of the ocean; retaining all the characteristics of
their surface-ancestors, but assuming the modifications by which they
are enabled to live in abyssal depths.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Lophius.</span>—Head exceedingly large, broad, depressed,
with the eyes on its upper surface; cleft of the mouth very
wide. Jaws and palate armed with rasp-like depressible teeth of
unequal size. Body naked; bones of the head armed with numerous
spines. The three anterior dorsal spines are isolated, situated
on the head, and modified into long tentacles; the three
following spines form a continuous fin; the soft dorsal and anal
short. Gills three. Young individuals have the tentacles beset
with lappets, and most of the fin-rays prolonged into filaments.</p>
</div>

<p>These fishes are well known under the names “Fishing-Frog,”
“Frog-fishes,” “Anglers,” or “Sea-devils.” They are coast-fishes,
living at very small depths. Four species are known: the British
species (<i>L. piscatorius</i>) found all round the coasts of Europe
and Western North America, and on the Cape of Good Hope; a second
(Mediterranean) species, <i>L. budegassa</i>; <i>L. setigerus</i> from
China and Japan; and <i>L. naresii</i> from the Admiralty Islands.</p>

     <p class="p0 center smaller">Fig. 210.—A young Fishing-Frog.</p>
  </div>

<p>The habits of all these species are identical. The wide<span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">[471]</span> mouth
extends all round the anterior circumference of the head, and both
jaws are armed with bands of long pointed teeth, which are inclined
inwards, and can be depressed so as to offer no impediment to an
object gliding towards the stomach, but prevent its escape from the
mouth. The pectoral and ventral fins are so articulated as to perform
the functions of teeth, the fish being enabled to move, or rather to
walk, on the bottom of the sea, where it generally hides itself in
the sand, or amongst seaweed. All round its head, and also along the
body, the skin bears fringed appendages, resembling short fronds of
seaweed; a structure which, combined with the extraordinary faculty of
assimilating the colours of the body to its surroundings, assists this
fish greatly in concealing itself in places which it selects on account
of the abundance of prey. To render the organisation of these creatures
perfect in relation to their wants, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_472">[472]</span> are provided with three long
filaments inserted along the middle of the head, which are, in fact,
the detached and modified three first spines of the anterior dorsal
fin. The filaments most important in the economy of the fishing-frogs
is the first, which is the longest, terminates in a lappet, and is
movable in every direction. There is no doubt that the Fishing-frog,
like many other fish provided with similar appendages, plays with this
filament as with a bait, attracting fishes, which, when sufficiently
near, are ingulfed by the simple act of the Fishing-frog opening its
gape. Its stomach is distensible in an extraordinary degree, and not
rarely fishes have been taken out of it quite as large and heavy as
their destroyer. The British species grows to a length of more than
five feet; specimens of three feet are common. Baird records that the
spawn of the same species has been observed as a floating sheet of
mucus, of from some 60 to 100 square feet.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Ceratias.</span>—Head and body much compressed and elevated;
cleft of the mouth wide, subvertical. Eyes very small. Teeth in

<p><span class="smcap">Himantolophus.</span>—Head and body compressed and elevated;

<p><span class="smcap">Antennarius.</span>—Head very large, high, compressed; cleft

or covered with minute spines; generally with tentacles. The
spinous dorsal is reduced to three isolated spines, the anterior

The soft dorsal of moderate length; anal short. Ventrals present.</p>
</div>

<p>The fishes of this genus are pelagic, frequently met with in mid-ocean
between the tropics, especially in parts of the sea with floating
vegetation; not rarely individuals are found far from their native
latitudes, carried by currents to the coasts of Norway and New Zealand.
Their power of swimming is most imperfect. When near the coast they
conceal themselves between corals, stones, or fucus, holding on to the
ground by means of their arm-like pectoral fins. Their coloration is so
similar to their surroundings that it is hardly possible to distinguish
the fish from a stone or coral overgrown with vegetation. Their way of
attracting and seizing their prey is evidently the same as in the other
fishes of this family. The extraordinary range of some of the species
which inhabit the Atlantic as well as the Indo-Pacific Oceans, is the
consequence of their habit of attaching themselves to floating objects.
Almost all the species are highly coloured, but the pattern of the
various colours varies exceedingly. These fishes do not attain to any
considerable size, and probably never exceed a length of ten inches. A
great number of species have been distinguished by ichthyologists, but
probably not more than twenty are known at present. The species figured
on p. 295 (<i>A. caudomaculatus</i>) is common in the Red Sea, and
probably occurs in other parts of the Indian Ocean.</p>

<p><i>Brachionichthys</i> and <i>Saccarius</i> are allied genera from
South Australia, Tasmania, and New Zealand.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Chaunax.</span>—Head very large, depressed; cleft of the
mouth wide, subvertical; eye small; rasp-like teeth in the jaws
and palate. Skin covered with minute spines. The spinous dorsal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">[475]</span>
is reduced to a small tentacle above the snout; the soft dorsal
of moderate length; anal short; ventrals present.</p>
</div>

<p>A deep-sea fish (<i>Ch. pictus</i>), of uniform pink colour; hitherto
found near Madeira and the Fidji Islands, at a depth of 215 fathoms.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Malthe.</span>—Anterior portion of the body very broad
and depressed. The anterior part of the snout is produced
into a more or less prominent process, beneath which there
is a tentacle retractile into a cavity. Jaws and palate with
villiform teeth. Skin with numerous conical protuberances. Soft
dorsal fin and anal very short. Gill-opening superiorly in the
axil; gills two and a half.</p>
</div>

<p>Although the rostral tentacle is situated at the lower side of the
projection of the snout, it must be regarded as the homologue of a
dorsal spine. In some of the preceding genera, <i>Oneirodes</i> and
<i>Chaunax</i>, the first dorsal spine is so far advanced on the snout
as to come into connection with the intermaxillary processes; and the
position of the rostral tentacle in <i>Malthe</i> is only a still more
advanced step towards the same special purpose for which the first
dorsal spine is used in this family, viz. for the purpose of obtaining
food. In <i>Malthe</i> it is obviously an organ of touch. This genus
belongs to the American shores of the Atlantic; <i>M. vespertilio</i>
being a tropical, <i>M. cubifrons</i> a northern species.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<i>Halieutichthys</i> from Cuba, and by <i>Dibranchus</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_476">[476]</span> dredged at
a depth of 360 fathoms off the coast of West Africa; the latter genus
possesses two gills only. Another genus, covered with large scattered
tubercles, <i>Aegæonichthys</i>, has recently been described from New
Zealand.</p>


<h6 class="smcap">Thirteenth Family—Cottidæ.</h6>

spine with the infraorbital ring. Two dorsal fins (rarely one), the
spinous being less developed than the soft and than the anal. Ventrals
thoracic, with five or less soft rays.</i></p>

<p>The fishes of this family are of small size, bad swimmers, and
generally living on the bottom, near the coasts, of almost all the
arctic, temperate, and tropical seas. Only a few live in fresh water.
They prefer shallow to deep water; and there is only one instance known
of a member of this family living at a great depth, viz. <i>Cottus
bathybius</i> from the Japanese sea, which is stated to have been
dredged in a depth of 565 fathoms. Fossil representatives are few
in number: two or three species of <i>Trigla</i>; others, although
having a general resemblance to the genus <i>Cottus</i>, were covered
with ctenoid scales, and therefore are referred to a distinct genus,
<i>Lepidocottus</i>; they are from tertiary formations.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Cottus.</span>—Head broad, depressed, rounded in front; body
sub-cylindrical, compressed posteriorly. Scaleless; lateral line
present. Pectoral rounded, with some or all the rays simple.

</div>

<p>The “Bull-heads” or “Miller’s Thumbs” are small fishes from the shores
and fresh waters of the northern temperate zone. Some forty species are
known; the greater number<span class="pagenum" id="Page_477">[477]</span> live in the northern half of the temperate
zone. On the shore, as well as in rivers, they prefer rocky or stony
to muddy ground, lying concealed between the stones, and watching for
their prey, which consists of small crustaceans and other aquatic
animals. The common British Miller’s Thumb (<i>C. gobio</i>) is found
in almost all suitable fresh waters of Northern and Central Europe,
especially in small streams, and extends into Northern Asia. Other
freshwater species abound in North America and Northern Asia. <i>Cottus
scorpius</i> and <i>C. bubalis</i>, the common European marine species,
range across the Atlantic to the American coasts. The male is said
to construct a nest, for the reception of the spawn, of seaweeds and
stones, and to anxiously watch and defend his offspring. The spine at
the angle of the præoperculum, which is simple in the majority of the
freshwater species, is frequently armed with accessory processes, and
antler-like, in marine.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Cantridermichthys</span> differs from <i>Cottus</i> in having

<p>About forty species are known, of which some attain a length of
two feet. This genus represents in the tropical Indian Ocean the
<i>Cotti</i> of the Arctic, and the <i>Nototheniæ</i> of the Antarctic
zone. Like these, they live on the bottom in shallow water, hidden
in the sand, the colours of which are assimilated by those of their
body. Therefore, they are very scarce near coral islands which are
surrounded by great depths; whilst the number of species is rather
considerable on many points of the shelving Australian coasts. Their
long and strong ventral fins are of great use to them in locomotion.
<i>P. insidiator</i> is one of the most common Indian and Australian
fishes, and readily recognised by two oblique black bands on the upper
and lower caudal lobes.</p>

<p>About forty species of “Gurnards” are known from tropical and temperate
zones. They are too well known to need detailed description; one of
their principal characteristics is the three free finger-like pectoral
appendages, which serve as organs of locomotion as well as touch, and
which are supplied with strong nerves, as noticed above (pp. 108 and
120). The fins are frequently beautifully ornamented, especially the
inner side of the long and broad pectorals, which is most exposed to
the light when the fish is floating on the surface of the water, with
pectorals spread out like wings. The grunting noise made by Gurnards
when taken out of the water is caused by the escape of gas from the
air-bladder through the open pneumatic duct. Gurnards are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_480">[480]</span> generally
used as food; seven species occur on the British coast: the Red
Gurnard (<i>T. pini</i>), the Streaked Gurnard (<i>T. lineata</i>),
the Sapphirine Gurnard (<i>T. hirundo</i>), the Grey Gurnard (<i>T.
gurnardus</i>), Bloch’s Gurnard (<i>T. cuculus</i>), the Piper (<i>T.
lyra</i>), and the Long-finned Gurnard (<i>T. obscura</i> or <i>T.
lucerna</i>). Singularly, the European species cross the Atlantic
but rarely, the American species belonging chiefly to the division
<i>Prionotus</i>.</p>

<p>Several other genera belong to this family; for completeness’
sake they are mentioned here, viz. <i>Bunocottus</i> from Cape
Horn; <i>Rhamphocottus</i>, <i>Triglops</i> from Arctic North
America; <i>Podabrus</i>, <i>Blepsias</i>, <i>Nautichthys</i>,

<p>Of “Flying Gurnards” three species only are known, which are very
abundant in the Mediterranean, the tropical Atlantic, and Indo-Pacific.
They, and the Flying Herrings (Exocoetus), are the only fishes which
are enabled by their long pectoral fins to take flying leaps out of the
water, and deserve the name of “Flying-Fishes.” They are much heavier,
and attain to a larger size, than the Exocoeti, specimens of eighteen
inches in length not being scarce. When young, their pectorals are much
shorter, and, consequently, they are unable to raise themselves out of
the water (<i>Cephalacanthus</i>).</p>

<p>The vertebral column shows a singular coalescence of the anterior
vertebræ, which form a simple tube, as in <i>Fistularia</i>.</p>

<h6 class="smcap">Fifteenth Family—Pegasidæ.</h6>

<p><i>Body entirely covered with bony plates, anchylosed on the trunk
and movable on the tail. Barbels none. The margin of the upper jaw is
formed by the intermaxillaries and their cutaneous prolongation, which
extends downwards to the extremity of the maxillaries. Gill-cover
formed by a large plate, homologous to the operculum, præoperculum,
and sub-operculum; interoperculum a long fine bone, hidden below the
gill-plate. One rudimentary branchiostegal. The gill-plate is united
with the isthmus by a narrow membrane; gill-openings narrow, in front
of the base of the pectoral fin. Gills four, lamellated. Pseudobranchiæ
and air-bladder absent. One short dorsal and anal fin, opposite to each
other. Ventral fin present. Ovarian sacs closed.</i></p>

<p>One genus only is known, <i>Pegasus</i>. Its pectoral fins are broad,
horizontal, long, composed of simple rays, some of which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_483">[483]</span> are sometimes
spinous. Ventral fins one- or two-rayed. Upper part of the snout
produced into a shorter or longer process. Mouth inferior, toothless.
Suborbital ring well developed, forming a suture with the gill-cover.
Vertebræ in small number, thin; no ribs. Four species are known,
two of which are of a shorter, and the two others of a longer form.
The former are <i>P. draconis</i>, common in the Indian Ocean, and
<i>P. volans</i>, which is frequently stuck by the Chinese into the
insect-boxes which they manufacture for sale. The two elongate species,
<i>P. natans</i> and <i>P. lancifer</i>, are from the Chinese and
Australian coasts. They are all very small fishes, probably living on
sandy shoal places near the coast.</p>

<p>Three species of “Lump-suckers” are known from the northern temperate
and the arctic zones. The common North European and North American
species, <i>C. lumpus</i>, is known also by the names of “Cock-
and Hen-Paddle.” It attains to a length of twenty-four inches, but
generally is much smaller. It is difficult to remove it from any object
to which it once has attached itself by means of its sucking-disk. Its
skin is so thick as to more or less entirely conceal the first dorsal
fin; it is covered with rough tubercles, the larger ones being arranged
in four series along each side of the body. In young specimens these
tubercles are absent. The arctic species, <i>C. spinosus</i>, has large
conical plates on the head and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_485">[485]</span> body, each plate with a spine in the
centre. Also of this species the young are naked, the plates making
only gradually their appearance, in the form of groups of tubercles.
Their development is irregular, as young specimens of the same size may
be entirely naked or tubercular. This species ranges beyond the 81°
lat. N.</p>

attached to the isthmus.</i></p>

<p>Small carnivorous littoral fishes, many of which have become
acclimatised in fresh water. They are very abundant with regard to
species as well as individuals, and found on or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_486">[486]</span> near the coasts of all
temperate and tropical regions. Geologically they appear first in the
chalk.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

  </div>

<p>The “Gobies” are distributed over all temperate and tropical coasts,
and abundant, especially on the latter. Nearly three hundred species
have been described. They live especially on rocky coasts, attaching
themselves firmly with their ventrals to a rock in almost any position,
and thus withstanding the force of the waves. Many of the species seem
to delight in darting from place to place in the rush of water which
breaks upon the shore. Others live in quiet brackish water, and not
a few have become entirely acclimatised in fresh water, especially
lakes. The males of some species construct nests for the eggs,
which they jealously watch, and defend even for some time after the
young are hatched. Several species are found on the British coast:
<i>G. niger</i>, <i>paganellus</i>, <i>auratus</i>, <i>minutus</i>,
<i>ruthensparri</i>. Fossil species of this genus have been found at
Monte Bolca.</p>

<p>A very small Goby, <i>Latrunculus pellucidus</i>, common in some
localities of the British Islands and other parts of Europe, is
distinguished by its transparent body, wide mouth, and uniserial
dentition. According to R. Collett it offers some very remarkable
peculiarities. It lives one year only, being the first instance of an
<i>annual vertebrate</i>. It spawns in June and July, the eggs are
hatched in August, and the fishes attain their full growth in the
months from October to December. In this stage the sexes are quite
alike, both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_487">[487]</span> having very small teeth and feeble jaws. In April the
males lose the small teeth, which are replaced by very long and strong
teeth, the jaws themselves becoming stronger. The teeth of the females
remain unchanged. In July and August all the adults die off, and in
September only the fry are to be found.</p>

<p>There are several other genera, closely allied to Gobius, as
<i>Euctenogobius</i>, <i>Lophiogobius</i>, <i>Doliichthys</i>,
<i>Apocryptes</i>, <i>Evorthodus</i>, <i>Gobiosoma</i> and
<i>Gobiodon</i> (with scaleless body) <i>Triænophorichthys</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Sicydium.</span>—Body covered with ctenoid scales of rather
small size. Cleft of the mouth nearly horizontal, with the upper
jaw prominent; lips very thick; the lower lip generally with a
series of minute horny teeth. A series of numerous small teeth
in upper jaw, implanted in the gum, and generally movable;
the lower jaw with a series of conical widely-set teeth. Two
dorsal fins, the anterior with six flexible spines. Ventral fins
united, and forming a short disk, more or less adherent to the
abdomen.</p>
</div>

<p>Small freshwater fishes inhabiting the rivers and rivulets of the
islands of the tropical Indo-Pacific. About twelve species are known;
one occurs in the West Indies. <i>Lentipes</i> from the Sandwich
Islands is allied to <i>Sicydium</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Periophthalmus.</span>—Body covered with ctenoid scales of
small or moderate size. Cleft of the mouth nearly horizontal,
with the upper jaw somewhat longer. Eyes very close together,
immediately below the upper profile, prominent, but retractile,
with a well-developed outer eyelid. Teeth conical, vertical in
both jaws. Two dorsal fins, the anterior with flexible spines;
caudal fin with the lower margin oblique; base of the pectoral
fin free, with strong muscles. Ventral fins more or less
coalesced. Gill-openings narrow.</p>
</div>

<p>The fishes of this genus, and the closely-allied <i>Boleophthalmus</i>,
are exceedingly common on the coasts of the tropical Indo-Pacific,
especially on parts covered with mud or fucus. During ebb they leave
the water and hunt for small crustaceans,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_488">[488]</span> and other small animals
disporting themselves on the ground which is left uncovered by the
receding water. With the aid of their strong pectoral and ventral fins
and their tail, they hop freely over the ground, and escape danger
by rapid leaps. The peculiar construction of their eyes, which are
very movable, and can be thrust far out of their sockets, enables
them to see in the air as well as in the water; when the eyes are
retracted they are protected by a membranous eyelid. These fishes
are absent in the eastern parts of the Pacific and on the American
side of the Atlantic; but singularly enough one species reappears
on the West African coast. About seven species are known (including
<i>Boleophthalmus</i>), <i>P. koelreuteri</i> being one of the most
common fishes of the Indian Ocean.</p>

</div>

<p>About sixty species are known from the tropics, only a few extending
into the temperate zone. As regards form, they repeat almost all the
modifications observed among the Gobies, from which they differ only
in having the ventral fins non-coalescent. On the whole they are
somewhat larger than the Gobies, and rather freshwater than marine
species, some of them being abundant in the rivulets of the islands of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_489">[489]</span>
the Indo-Pacific and Atlantic. Others have even penetrated into the
inland-waters of the African continent.</p>

angle of the præoperculum. Two dorsal fins, the anterior with
three or four flexible spines; ventrals five-rayed, widely apart
from each other. Gill-openings very narrow, generally reduced to
a foramen on the upper side of the operculum.</p>
</div>

<p>The “Dragonets” are small, and generally beautifully coloured marine
fishes, inhabitants of the coasts of the temperate zone of the
Old World; the minority of species live in tropical parts of the
Indo-Pacific; and these seem to descend to somewhat greater depths
than the littoral species of the northern hemisphere. Secondary sexual
characters are developed in almost all the species, the mature males
having the fin-rays prolonged into filaments, and the fin-membranes
brightly ornamented. On the British coast one species (<i>C. draco</i>)
is very common, and locally called “Skulpin.” About thirty species are
known, many of which have the præopercular spine armed with processes
or barbs. <i>Vulsus</i> is allied to <i>Callionymus</i>.</p>

<p>Other genera belonging to this family are—<i>Benthophilus</i> from the
Caspian Sea; <i>Amblyopus</i>, <i>Orthostomus</i>, <i>Platyptera</i>,
<i>Luciogobius</i>, <i>Oxymetopon</i>, and, perhaps, <i>Oxuderces</i>.</p>

<p><i>Body elongate, low, more or less cylindrical, naked or covered with
scales, which generally are small. One, two, or three dorsal fins
occupying nearly the whole length of the back, the spinous portion,
if distinct, being as much developed as the soft, or more; sometimes
the entire fin is composed of spines; anal fin long. Ventrals jugular,
composed of a few rays, and sometimes rudimentary or entirely absent.
Pseudobranchiæ generally present.</i></p>

<p>Littoral forms of great generic variety, occurring abundantly in
all temperate and tropical seas. Some of the species have become
acclimatised in fresh water, and many inhabit brackish water. With
very few exceptions they are very small, some of the smallest
fishes belonging to the family of “Blennies.” One of the principal
characteristics of the Blennies is the ventral fin, which is formed by
less than five rays, and has a jugular position. The Blennies have this
in common with many Gadoids, and it is sometimes difficult to decide to
which of these two families a fish should be referred. In such doubtful
cases the presence of the pseudobranchiæ (which are absent in Gadoids)
may be of assistance.</p>

<p>In many Blennies the ventral fins have ceased to have any function, and
become rudimentary, or are even entirely absent. In others the ventral
fins, although reduced to cylindrical stylets, possess a distinct
function, and are used as organs of locomotion, by the aid of which the
fish moves rapidly over the bottom.</p>

<p>The fossil forms are scarcely known; <i>Pterygocephalus</i> from Monte
Bolca appears to have been a Blennioid.</p>

<p>The “Sea-wolf,” or “Sea-cat” (<i>A. lupus</i>), is a gigantic Blenny,
attaining to a length of more than six feet. With its enormously strong
tubercular teeth it is able to crush the hardest shells of Crustaceans
or Mollusks, on which it feeds voraciously. It is an inhabitant of the
northern seas, like two other allied species, all of which are esteemed
as food by the inhabitants of Iceland and Greenland. Two other species
of Sea-wolves occur in the corresponding latitudes of the North Pacific.</p>

<p>About forty species of Blennius (in the restricted generic sense)
are known from the northern temperate zone, the tropical Atlantic,
Tasmania, and the Red Sea. But in the tropical Indian Ocean they are
almost entirely absent, and replaced by other allied genera. Three
species, found near the Sandwich Islands, are immigrants into the
Pacific from the American Continent. They generally live on the coast,
or attach themselves to floating objects, some species leading a
pelagic life, hiding themselves in floating seaweed, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_494">[494]</span> which they
even propagate their species. All species readily accustom themselves
to fresh water, and some (<i>B. vulgaris</i>) have become entirely
acclimatised in inland lakes. British species are <i>B. gattorugine</i>
(growing to a length of twelve inches), <i>B. ocellaris</i>, <i>B.

<p>Sixty species are known from the tropical zone, extending northwards to

young individuals lack it, and in some other species it is invariably
absent. Singularly enough this crest is not always a sexual character,
as one might have supposed from analogy, but in some species at least
it is developed in both sexes. Mature males, however, have generally
higher dorsal fins and a more intense and variegated coloration than
females and immature males, as is also the case in <i>Blennius</i>.</p>

teeth in the jaws and on the palate. Dorsal fin formed by
numerous spines and a few soft rays, without a detached anterior
portion; anal spines two. Ventrals with two or three rays. A
tentacle above the orbit. Gill-opening wide.</p>
</div>

<p>Thirty species, from the coasts of tropical America and the southern
temperate zone. Three other genera are closely allied to Clinus,
viz. <i>Cristiceps</i> and <i>Cremnobates</i>, in which the three
anterior dorsal spines are detached from the rest of the fin; and
<i>Tripterygium</i>, with three distinct dorsal fins, of which the
two anterior are spinous. The species of these genera are as numerous
as those of <i>Clinus</i>, occurring in many parts of tropical seas,
in the Mediterranean, and being especially well represented in South
Australia and New Zealand.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Stichæus.</span>—Body elongate, covered with very small

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Blenniops.</span>—Body moderately elongate, covered with very

<p>A fine but not common kind of Blenny (<i>B. ascanii</i>), from the
British and Scandinavian coasts.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Centronotus.</span>—Body elongate, covered with very small

gill-membranes coalescent.</p>
</div>

<p>Ten species are known from the northern coasts; southwards the genus
extends to the coasts of France, New York, California, and Japan. <i>C.
gunellus</i>, or the “Gunnel-fish” or “Butter-fish,” is common on the
British coasts. <i>Apodichthys</i> is allied to <i>Centronotus</i>, but
the vertical fins are confluent; and a very large, excavated, pen-like
spine lies hidden in a pouch in front of the anal fin. This spine is
evidently connected in some way with the generative organs, as a furrow
leads from the orifice of the oviduct to the groove of the spine. One
species from the Pacific coast of North America. <i>Xiphidion</i> is
another closely allied genus from the same locality.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Cryptacanthodes.</span>—Body very elongate, naked, with

Ventrals short, formed by three or four rays. Gill-openings wide.</p>
</div>

<p>Two species are known, one from the European, and the other from the
North American side of the Atlantic. The former, <i>Z. viviparus</i>,
is well known by the name of “Viviparous Blenny;” as is signified by
this name it produces its young alive. These are so matured at the
time of their birth that on their first exclusion they swim about with
the utmost agility. No fewer than from two to three hundred young are
sometimes produced by one female, and the abdomen of the mother is so
distended before parturition that it is impossible to touch it without
causing them to be extruded. Full grown individuals are about twelve
inches long, but the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_498">[498]</span> American species (<i>Z. anguillaris</i>) attains
to a length of two or three feet.</p>

<p>Other genera of the family of Blennoids are:—<i>Blennophis</i>,
<i>Nemophis</i>, <i>Plagiotremus</i>, <i>Neoclinus</i>,
<i>Cebidichthys</i>, <i>Myxodes</i>, <i>Heterostichus</i>,
<i>Dictyosoma</i>, <i>Lepidoblennius</i>, <i>Dactyloscopus</i>,
<i>Gunellichthys</i>, <i>Urocentrus</i>, <i>Stichæopsis</i>,
<i>Sticharium</i>, <i>Notograptus</i>, <i>Pholidichthys</i>, and
<i>Pseudoblennius</i>.</p>


<h6 class="smcap">Fifth Family—Acanthoclinidæ.</h6>

<p><i>Body elongate, low, compressed, covered with small scales. One
dorsal fin, occupying nearly the whole of the back, and chiefly
composed of spines. Anal fin long, with numerous spines. Ventrals
jugular, composed of a few rays only.</i></p>

<p>Of this family one fish only is known (<i>Acanthoclinus littoreus</i>),
a small Blenny abundant on the coast of New Zealand.</p>


<h6 class="smcap">Sixth Family—Mastacembelidæ.</h6>

<p><i>Body elongate, eel-like, covered with very small scales. Mandible
long, but little moveable. Dorsal fin very long, the anterior portion
composed of numerous short isolated spines; anal fin with spines
anteriorly. Ventrals none. The humeral arch is not suspended from the
skull. Gill-openings reduced to a slit at the lower part of the side of
the head.</i></p>

<p>Freshwater-fishes characteristic of and almost confined to the Indian
region. The structure of the mouth and of the branchial apparatus, the
separation of the humeral arch from the skull, the absence of ventral
fins, the anatomy of the abdominal organs, affords ample proof that
these fishes are Acanthopterygian eels. Their upper jaw terminates in a
pointed moveable appendage, which is concave and transversely striated
inferiorly in <i>Rhynchobdella</i>, and without transverse striæ in
<i>Mastacembelus</i>: the only two genera of this family.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_499">[499]</span> Thirteen
species are known, of which <i>Rh. aculeata</i>, <i>M. pancalus</i>
and <i>M. armatus</i> are extremely common, the latter attaining to
a length of two feet. Outlying species are <i>M. aleppensis</i> from
Mesopotamia and Syria, and <i>M. cryptacanthus</i>, <i>M. marchei</i>,
and <i>M. niger</i>, from West Africa.</p>

<h5 class="smcap">Eleventh Division—Acanthopterygii Mugiliformes.</h5>

<p><i>Two dorsal fins more or less remote from each other; the anterior
either short, like the posterior, or composed of feeble spines. Ventral
fins with one spine and five rays, abdominal.</i></p>


<h6 class="smcap">First Family—Sphyrænidæ.</h6>

<p><i>Body elongate, sub-cylindrical, covered with small cycloid scales;
lateral line continuous. Cleft of the mouth wide, armed with strong
teeth. Eye lateral, of moderate size. Vertebræ twenty-four.</i></p>

<p>This family consists of one genus only, <i>Sphyræna</i>, generally
called “Barracudas,” large voracious fishes from the tropical and
sub-tropical seas, which prefer the vicinity of the coast to the open
sea. They attain to a length of eight feet, and a weight of forty
pounds; individuals of this large size are dangerous to bathers. They
are generally used as food, but sometimes (especially in the West
Indies) their flesh assumes poisonous qualities, from having fed on
smaller poisonous fishes. Seventeen species.</p>

<p>The Barracudas existed in the tertiary epoch, their remains being
frequently found at Monte Bolca. Some other fossil genera have been
associated with them, but as they are known from jaws and teeth
or vertebræ only, their position in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_500">[500]</span> system cannot be exactly
determined; thus <i>Sphyrænodus</i> and <i>Hypsodon</i> from the chalk
of Lewes, and the London clay of Sheppey. The American <i>Portheus</i>
is allied to <i>Hypsodon</i>. Another remarkable genus from the chalk,
<i>Saurocephalus</i>, has been also referred to this family.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>


<h6 class="smcap">Second Family—Atherinidæ.</h6>

<p><i>Body more or less elongate, sub-cylindrical, covered with scales of
moderate size; lateral line indistinct. Cleft of the mouth of moderate
width, with the dentition feeble. Eye lateral, large or of moderate
size. Gill-openings wide. Vertebræ very numerous.</i></p>

<p>Small carnivorous fishes inhabiting the seas of the temperate and
tropical zones; many enter fresh water, and some have been entirely
acclimatised in it. This family seems to have been represented in the
Monte Bolca formation by <i>Mesogaster</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Atherina.</span>—Teeth very small; scales cycloid. The first
dorsal is short and entirely separated from the second. Snout
obtuse, with the cleft of the mouth straight, oblique, extending
to or beyond the anterior margin of the eye.</p>
</div>

<p>The Atherines are littoral fishes, living in large shoals, which habit
has been retained by the species acclimatised in fresh water. They
rarely exceed a length of six inches, but are nevertheless esteemed
as food. From their general resemblance to the real Smelt they are
often thus misnamed, but may always be readily recognised by their
small first spinous dorsal fin. The young, for some time after they
are hatched, cling together in dense masses, and in numbers almost
incredible. The inhabitants of the Mediterranean<span class="pagenum" id="Page_501">[501]</span> coast of France call
these newly hatched Atherines “Nonnat” (unborn). Some thirty species
are known, of which <i>A. presbyter</i> and <i>A. boyeri</i> occur on
the British coast.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Atherinichthys</span>, distinguished from <i>Atherina</i> in
having the snout more or less produced; and the cleft of the
mouth generally does not extend to the orbit.</p>
</div>

<p>These Atherines are especially abundant on the coasts and in the fresh
waters of Australia and South America. Of the twenty species known,
several attain a length of eighteen inches and a weight of more than a
pound. All are highly esteemed as food; but the most celebrated is the
“Pesce Rey” of Chile (<i>A. laticlavia</i>).</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Tetragonurus.</span>—Body rather elongate, covered with
strongly keeled and striated scales. The first dorsal fin is
composed of numerous feeble spines, and continued on to the
second. Lower jaw elevated, with convex dental margin, and armed
with compressed, triangular, rather small teeth, in a single
series.</p>
</div>

<p>This very remarkable fish is more frequently met with in the
Mediterranean than in the Atlantic, but generally scarce. Nothing is
known of its habits; when young it is one of the fishes which accompany
Medusæ, and, therefore, it must be regarded as a pelagic form.
Probably, at a later period of its life, it descends to greater depths,
coming to the surface at night only. It grows to a length of eighteen
inches.</p>


<h6 class="smcap">Third Family—Mugilidæ.</h6>

<p><i>Body more or less oblong and compressed, covered with cycloid scales
of moderate size; lateral line none. Cleft of the mouth narrow or of
moderate width, without or with feeble teeth. Eye lateral, of moderate
size. Gill-opening wide. The anterior dorsal fin composed of four stiff
spines. Vertebræ twenty-four.</i></p>

<p>The “Grey Mullets” inhabit in numerous species and in great numbers the
coasts of the temperate and tropical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_502">[502]</span> zones. They frequent brackish
waters, in which they find an abundance of food which consists chiefly
of the organic substances mixed with mud or sand; in order to prevent
larger bodies from passing into the stomach, or substances from passing
through the gill-openings, these fishes have the organs of the pharynx
modified into a filtering apparatus. They take in a quantity of sand or
mud, and, after having worked it for some time between the pharyngeal
bones, they eject the roughest and indigestible portion of it. The
upper pharyngeals have a rather irregular form; they are slightly
arched, the convexity being directed towards the pharyngeal cavity,
tapering anteriorly and broad posteriorly. They are coated with a thick
soft membrane, which reaches far beyond the margin of the bone, at
least on its interior posterior portion; this membrane is studded all
over with minute horny cilia. The pharyngeal bone rests upon a large
fatty mass, giving it a considerable degree of elasticity. There is a
very large venous sinus between the anterior portion of the pharyngeal
and the basal portion of the branchial arches. Another mass of fat,
of elliptical form, occupies the middle of the roof of the pharynx,
between the two pharyngeal bones. Each branchial arch is provided
on each side, in its whole length, with a series of closely-set
gill-rakers, which are laterally bent downwards, each series closely
fitting into the series of the adjoining arch; they constitute together
a sieve, admirably adapted to permit a transit for the water, retaining
at the same time every other substance in the cavity of the pharynx.</p>

<p>The lower pharyngeal bones are elongate, crescent-shaped, and
broader posteriorly than anteriorly. Their inner surface is concave,
corresponding to the convexity of the upper pharyngeals, and provided
with a single series of lamellæ, similar to those of the branchial
arches, but reaching across the bone from one margin to the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_503">[503]</span></p>

<p>The intestinal tract shows no less peculiarities. The lower portion
of the œsophagus is provided with numerous long thread-like papillæ,
and continued into the oblong-ovoid membranaceous cœcal portion of the
stomach, the mucosa of which forms several longitudinal folds. The
second portion of the stomach reminds one of the stomach of birds;
it communicates laterally with the other portion, is globular, and
surrounded by an exceedingly strong muscle. This muscle is not divided
into two as in birds, but of great thickness in the whole circumference
of the stomach, all the muscular fasciculi being circularly arranged.
The internal cavity of this stomach is rather small, and coated with a
tough epithelium, longitudinal folds running from the entrance opening
to the pyloric, which is situated opposite to the other. A low circular
valve forms a pylorus. There are five rather short pyloric appendages.
The intestines make a great number of circumvolutions, and are seven
feet long in a specimen thirteen inches in length.</p>

  </div>

<p>Some seventy species of Grey Mullets are known, the majority of which
attain to a weight of about four pounds, but there are many which
grow to ten and twelve pounds. All are eaten, and some even esteemed,
especially when taken out of fresh water. If attention were paid to
their cultivation, great profits could be made by fry being transferred
into suitable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_504">[504]</span> backwaters on the shore, in which they rapidly grow
to a marketable size. Several species are more or less abundant on
the British coasts, as <i>Mugil octo-radiatus</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig105">105</a>, p. 254),
<i>M. capito</i>, <i>M. auratus</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig106">106</a>, p. 254), and <i>M.
septentrionalis</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig107">107</a>, p. 254), which, with the aid of the
accompanying figures, and by counting the rays of the anal fin, may
be readily distinguished—<i>M. octo-radiatus</i> having eight, and
<i>M. capito</i> and <i>M. auratus</i> nine soft rays. A species
inhabiting fresh waters of Central America (<i>M. proboscideus</i>)
has the snout pointed and fleshy, thus approaching certain other
freshwater and littoral Mullets, which, on account of a modification
of the structure of the mouth, have been formed into a distinct genus,
<i>Agonostoma</i>. <i>Myxus</i> comprises Mullets with teeth more
distinct than in the typical species.</p>

<p>This genus existed in the tertiary epoch, remains of a species having
been found in the gypsum of Aix, in Provence.</p>


<h5 class="smcap">Twelfth Division—Acanthopterygii Gastrosteiformes.</h5>

<p><i>The spinous dorsal is composed of isolated spines if present;
the ventrals are either thoracic or have an abdominal position in
consequence of the prolongation of the pubic bones which are attached
to the humeral arch. Mouth small, at the end of the snout which is
generally more or less produced.</i></p>


<h6 class="smcap">First Family—Gastrosteidæ.</h6>

<p><i>Body elongate, compressed. Cleft of the mouth oblique; villiform
teeth in the jaws. Opercular bones not armed; infraorbitals covering
the cheek; parts of the skeleton forming incomplete external mails.
Scales none, but generally large scutes along the side. Isolated spines
in front of the soft dorsal fin. Ventral fins abdominal, joined to
the pubic bone, composed of a spine and a small ray. Branchiostegals
three.</i></p>

     <p class="p0 center smaller">Fig. 230.—Gastrosteus noveboracensis.</p>
  </div>

<p>Of “Sticklebacks” (<i>Gastrosteus</i>) about ten species are
satisfactorily known, one of which (<i>G. spinachia</i>) lives in
salt and brackish water, whilst the others inhabit principally fresh
waters, although they all are able to exist in the sea. They are
confined to the Temperate and Arctic zones of the northern hemisphere.
The British freshwater species are the Three-spined Stickleback (<i>G.
aculeatus</i>), which sometimes, especially in Central Europe, lacks
scutes, sometimes has a series of scutes along the side of the body;
the Four-spined Stickleback (<i>G. spinulosus</i>) and the Nine-spined
Stickleback (<i>G. pungitius</i>). The commonest North American species
is <i>G. noveboracensis</i>. The habits of all the freshwater species
are very similar. The common European species (<i>G. aculeatus</i>)
is an active and greedy little fish, extremely destructive to the fry
of other species, and consequently injurious in ponds where these are
sought to be preserved. It is scarcely to be conceived what damage
these little fishes do, and how greatly detrimental they are to the
increase of all the fishes in general among which they live; for it is
with the utmost industry, sagacity, and greediness that they seek out
and destroy all the young fry that come their way. A small Stickleback,
kept in an aquarium, devoured, in five hours’ time, seventy-four young
dace, which were about a quarter of an inch long, and of the thickness
of a horse hair. Two days after it swallowed sixty-two; and would,
probably, have eaten as many every day could they have been procured.
The Stickleback<span class="pagenum" id="Page_506">[506]</span> sometimes swarms in prodigious numbers. Pennant states
that at Spalding, in Lincolnshire, there was once in seven years
amazing shoals, which appear in the Welland, coming up the river in the
form of a vast column. The quantity may, perhaps, be conceived from the
fact that a man employed in collecting them, gained, for a considerable
time, four shillings a-day by selling them at the rate of a halfpenny a
bushel. Costa, who studied the manners of these small fishes, relates
that, on the approach of spawning time, the male builds a nest of
stalks of grass and other matters in a hollow of the bottom, a little
above three inches wide and about six inches and a half deep, creeping
over the materials on his belly, and cementing them with the mucus that
exudes from his skin. The bottom of the nest is first laid, then the
sides are raised, and lastly the top is covered over. A small hole is
left on one side for an entrance. When the erection is complete, he
seeks out a female, and conducting her, Costa says, with many caresses,
to the nest, introduces her by the door into the chamber. In a few
minutes she has laid two or three eggs, after which she bores a hole on
the opposite side of the nest to that by which she entered, and makes
her escape. The nest has now two doors, and the eggs are exposed to
the cool stream of water, which, entering by one door flows out at the
other. Next day the male goes again in quest of a female, and sometimes
brings back the same, sometimes finds a new mate. This is repeated
until the nest contains a considerable number of eggs, and each time
the male rubs his side against the female and passes over the eggs.
Next the male watches a whole month over his treasure, defending it
stoutly against all invaders, and especially against his wives, who
have a great desire to get at the eggs. When the young are hatched and
able to do for themselves his cares cease.</p>

<p>The Sea-Stickleback (<i>G. spinachia</i>) is likewise a nest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_507">[507]</span> builder,
choosing for its operations especially the shallows of brackish water,
which are covered with <i>Zostera</i>.</p>


<h6 class="smcap">Second Family—Fistulariidæ.</h6>

<p><i>Fishes of greatly elongated form; the anterior bones of the skull
are much produced, and form a long tube, terminating in a narrow mouth.
Teeth small; scales none, or small. The spinous dorsal fin is either
formed by feeble isolated spines or entirely absent; the soft dorsal
and anal of moderate length, ventral fins thoracic or abdominal,
composed of five or six rays, without spine; if abdominal, they are
separate from the pubic bones, which remain attached to the humeral
arch. Branchiostegals five.</i></p>

<p>The “Flute-mouths” are also frequently called “Pipe-fishes,” a name
which they have in common with the Syngnathidæ. They are gigantic
marine Sticklebacks, living near the shore, from which they are
frequently driven into the open sea; some of the species, therefore,
have a wide geographical range. Probably all enter brackish water. They
are distributed over the whole of the tropical and sub-tropical parts
of the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific. The species are few in number, but
some of them are very common.</p>

<p>This family is well represented in Eocene formations; some of
the remains belonging to the existing genera, <i>Fistularia</i>,
<i>Aulostoma</i>, and <i>Auliscops</i>, the two former of which occur
not rarely at Monte Bolca and in the schists of Glaris. Well-preserved
remains of <i>Auliscops</i> have been found in the Marl-slates of the
highlands of Padang in Sumatra. Extinct genera from Monte Bolca are
<i>Urosphen</i>, the cylindrical body of which is terminated by a large
cuneiform fin; and <i>Rhamphosus</i>, which has an immense spinous ray,
denticulated behind, inserted on the nape.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_508">[508]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Fistularia.</span>—Body scaleless; caudal fin forked, with
the two middle rays produced into a filament; no free dorsal
spines.</p>
</div>

<p>Three species are known, common on the shores of the Tropical Atlantic
(<i>F. tabaccaria</i>) and Indian Oceans (<i>F. serrata</i> and <i>F.
depressa</i>); they attain to a length of from four to six feet.</p>

<p>The anterior portion of the vertebral column shows the same peculiarity
as in <i>Dactylopterus</i>; it is a long compressed tube, composed of
four elongate vertebræ, which are perfectly anchylosed; each of them
has a pair of small foramina for blood-vessels. The neural spines and
parapophyses of this tubiform portion are confluent into thin laminæ,
the lateral of which are wing-like, and expanded in their anterior half.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Aulostoma.</span>—Body covered with small scales. Caudal fin

<p>One species (<i>A. spinescens</i>) from the Pacific coast of North
America. <i>Aulorhynchus</i> from the same sea, and <i>Aulichthys</i>
from Japan, are allied genera.</p>


<h5 class="smcap">Thirteenth Division—Acanthopterygii Centrisciformes.</h5>

<p><i>Two dorsal fins; the spinous short, the soft and the anal
of moderate extent. Ventral fins truly abdominal, imperfectly
developed.</i></p>

<p>This division consists of one family, <i>Centriscidæ</i>, with two
genera. The fishes belonging to it are very small, marine, and, in
consequence of their limited power of swimming, often driven out into
the open sea. They have the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_509">[509]</span> structure of the mouth and snout
as the Fistulariidæ, but combine with it peculiarities of the shape
of body, of the structure of the vertical fins, and of the relations
between endo- and exo-skeleton, which render them altogether a singular
and interesting type. <i>Amphisile</i> has been found in a fossil state
at Monte Bolca.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Centriscus.</span>—Body oblong or elevated, compressed,
covered with small rough scales; lateral line none; some bony
strips on the side of the back, and on the margin of the thorax
and abdomen; the former, in one species, are confluent and form
a shield. Teeth none. Two dorsal fins, the first with one of the
spines very strong. Ventral fins small, abdominal, composed of
five soft rays. Four branchiostegals.</p>

<p>Of the four species the most generally known is <i>C. scolopax</i>,
the “Trumpet-fish” or “Bellows-fish,” which rarely occurs on the south
coast of England, is more common farther south, and reappears in
Tasmania. The allied <i>C. gracilis</i> is one of the fishes common
to the Mediterranean and Japanese Seas. The species figured, <i>C.
humerosus</i>, occurs on the coast of South Australia, and is very
scarce.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Amphisile.</span>—Body elongate, strongly compressed,
provided with a dorsal cuirass, which is formed by portions of
the skeleton; the longitudinal axis of the tail is not in the
same line with that of the trunk. Scales none. Teeth none. Two
dorsal fins situated on the hindmost part of the back; ventral
fins rudimentary, abdominal. Three or four branchiostegals.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_510">[510]</span></p>

<p>The three species known of this genus are found in the tropical
Indo-Pacific. Their body is so thin that it has the appearance of
being artificially compressed between two sheets of paper; it is
semi-transparent, especially in the region of the air-bladder. The
structure of the vertebral column is extremely singular and unique
among Acanthopterygians. The abdominal portion is more than four
times as long as the caudal; nevertheless it is composed of only
six vertebræ, whilst the latter consists of fourteen. The abdominal
vertebræ are extremely slender, the third alone being nearly as long
as the whole caudal portion; they have a slight ridge superiorly
and inferiorly, and on each side; the whole portion lying in the
uppermost concavity of the dorsal cuirass. The caudal vertebræ are
extremely short, and the strength of their neural and hæmal spines
is in proportion to their size. The dorsal cuirass is not a dermal
production, but formed by modified parts of the endoskeleton; its
composition, the number and condition of its single parts, and,
finally, the first dorsal spine, which in <i>A. punctulata</i> is so
singularly attached to it, favour this opinion. The plates, which
occupy the vertebral line, would correspond to the neural spines, and
the lateral plates on which the ribs are suspended to the parapophyses.
<i>Amphisile</i> may be considered as a Chelonian form among fishes.</p>


<h5 class="smcap">Fourteenth Division—Acanthopterygii Gobiesociformes.</h5>

<p><i>No spinous dorsal; the soft and the anal short or of moderate
length, situated on the tail; ventral fins subjugular, with an adhesive
apparatus between them. Body naked.</i></p>

<p>These fishes are well characterised by their single dorsal fin, and by
their adhesive ventral apparatus, which has only an external similarity
to the organ observed in <i>Cyclopterus</i> and <i>Liparis</i>; its
structure is typically different from it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_511">[511]</span> Whilst in those genera the
ventral fins occupy the centre of the disk forming its base, these
fins are here widely apart from each other, as in <i>Callionymus</i>,
forming only a portion of the periphery of the disk, which is completed
by a cartilaginous expansion of the coracoid bones. The following
description of its structure is taken from <i>Sicyases sanguineus</i>,
but it is essentially the same in all the genera.</p>

<p>The whole disk is exceedingly large, subcircular, longer than broad,
its length being one-third of the whole length of the fish. The central
portion is formed merely by skin, which is separated from the pelvic
or pubic bones by several layers of muscles. The peripheric portion is
divided into an anterior and posterior part by a deep notch behind the
ventrals. The anterior peripheric portion is formed by the four ventral
rays, the membrane between them, and a broad fringe which extends
anteriorly from one ventral to the other; this fringe is a fold of
the skin, containing on each side the rudimentary ventral spine, but
no cartilage. The posterior peripheric portion is suspended on each
side from the coracoid, the upper bone of which is exceedingly broad,
becoming a free movable plate behind the pectoral. A broad cartilage
is firmly attached to it. The lower bone of the coracoid is of a
triangular form, and supports a very broad fold of the skin, extending
from one side to the other, and containing a cartilage which runs
through the whole of that fold. Five processes of the cartilage are
continued into the soft striated margin in which the disk terminates
posteriorly. The surface of the disk is coated with thick epidermis,
like the sole of the foot of higher animals. The epidermis is divided
into many polygonal plates; there are no such plates between the roots
of the ventral fins.</p>

<p>Not less unique is the structure of the bones which have some
relation to this external adhesive apparatus. As exemplified by
<i>Chorismochismus dentex</i> the coracoid is well developed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_512">[512]</span> and, as
usual, composed of two pieces, the upper of which is not suspended from
the humerus, but fixed by a ligament to the hinder margin of the carpal
bones. It is a broad lamella, dilated posteriorly into the cartilage,
which is externally visible; the lower piece is narrower, and fixed to
the extremity of the pubic bone of its side. The pubic bones are united
by suture, and form together a heart-shaped disk, the point of which
is produced backwards. The anterior portion of the disk is concave,
with a bony longitudinal bridge and a feeble transverse ridge. The disk
is fixed to the humeral bones by the convex portions of its anterior
margin, whilst the convex portions of the lateral margins serve as
base for the ventral fins. The latter are composed of one spine, which
is transformed into a broad, thin, and curved plate, hidden below the
skin, and apparently of four rays; but on closer examination we find
that the hidden ray has a longitudinal groove anteriorly, in which
another thinner ray lies concealed. This ray is quite free, and not
joined to the pubic bone.</p>

<p>The fishes belonging to the single family of this division,
<i>Gobiesocidæ</i>, are strictly marine but littoral fishes. They
are scattered over the temperate zones of both hemispheres, and more
numerous than between the Tropics. All are of small or very small size.</p>

  </div>

<p>The adhesive disk consists of an anterior and posterior division.
In some of the genera the posterior division has no free anterior
margin, the teeth being either all conical, as in <i>Chorisochismus</i>
(Cape of Good Hope) and <i>Cotylis</i> (Red Sea<span class="pagenum" id="Page_513">[513]</span> and Indian Ocean);
or incisor-like in both jaws, as in <i>Sicyases</i> (coast of
Chili and West Indies); or incisor-like at least in the lower jaw,
as in <i>Gobiesox</i> (West Indies and Pacific coasts of South
America). In other genera the posterior portion of the adhesive
disk has a free anterior margin. Only one of these genera has
incisor-like teeth, viz. <i>Diplocrepis</i> from New Zealand. In
the remaining genera, <i>Crepidogaster</i> (from Tasmania and
South Australia), <i>Trachelochismus</i> (from New Zealand and the
Fiji Islands), <i>Lepadogaster</i>, and <i>Leptopterygius</i>, the
teeth are very small and fine. The two last genera are European,
and <i>Lepadogaster</i> at least is common on the Southern British
coasts. The three species known as British—<i>L. gouanii</i>, <i>L.
candollii</i>, and <i>L. bimaculatus</i>—are prettily coloured, but
subject to great variation.</p>

<h5 class="smcap">Fifteenth Division—Acanthopterygii Channiformes.</h5>

<p><i>Body elongate, covered with scales of moderate size; no spine in any
of the fins; dorsal and anal long. No superbranchial organ, only a bony
prominence on the anterior surface of the hyomandibular.</i></p>

<p>These fishes belong to the single family <i>Ophiocephalidæ</i>,
Freshwater-fishes characteristic of the Indian region, which, however,
have found their way into Africa, where they are represented by one or
two species. Thirty-one species are known altogether, most of which
are extremely abundant; some attain to a length of more than two feet.
Like other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_514">[514]</span> tropical freshwater fishes, they are able to survive
droughts, living in semi-fluid mud, or lying in a torpid state below
the hard-baked crusts of the bottom of a tank from which every drop
of water has disappeared. Respiration is probably entirely suspended
during the state of torpidity, but whilst the mud is still soft enough
to allow them to come to the surface, they rise at intervals to take in
a quantity of air, by means of which their blood is oxygenised. This
habit has been observed in some species to continue also to the period
of the year in which the fish lives in normal water, and individuals
which are kept in a basin and prevented from coming to the surface
and renewing the air for respiratory purposes, are suffocated. The
particular manner in which the accessory branchial cavity participates
in respiratory functions is not known. It is a simple cavity, without
an accessory branchial organ, the opening of which is partly closed by
a fold of the mucous membrane.</p>

<h6 class="smcap">First Family—Labyrinthici.</h6>

<p><i>Dorsal and anal spines present, but in variable numbers; ventrals

     <p class="p0 center smaller">Fig. 235.—Superbranchial organ of Anabas.</p>
  </div>

<p>Freshwater-fishes of the Cyprinoid division of the Equatorial zone.
They possess the faculty of being able to live for some time out of
the water, or in thick or hardened mud, in a still greater degree than
the fishes of the preceding family. In the accessory branchial cavity
there is lodged a laminated organ which evidently has the function of
assisting in the oxygenisation of the blood. In <i>Anabas</i> it is
formed by several exceedingly thin bony laminæ, similar in form to the
auricle, and concentrically situated one above the other, the innermost
being the largest. The degree in which these laminæ are developed
is dependent on age. In specimens from one inch and a half to two
inches and a half long there are only two such laminæ, a third being
indicated by a small protuberance at the central base of the second
or outer laminæ. In specimens of from three to four inches in length
the third lamina is developed, covering one-half of the second. The
edges of all the laminæ are straight, not valanced. In specimens of
from four to five inches a fourth lamina makes its appearance in the
basal centre of the third lamina. The other laminæ continue to grow in
their circumference, and their edges now become undulated and slightly
frilled. Cuvier and Valenciennes have examined still larger specimens.
The figure given by them and reproduced here was taken from a specimen
six or seven inches long, and shows the superbranchial organ composed
of six laminæ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_516">[516]</span></p>

<p>The air-bladder of the majority of these fishes is very large,
extending far into the tail, and, therefore, divided behind by the
hæmal spines into two lateral portions.</p>

<p>The Labyrinthici are generally of small size; they are capable of being
domesticated, and some of them deserve particular attention on account
of the dazzling beauty of their colours or the flavour of their flesh.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Anabas.</span>—Body compressed, oblong; præorbital and
orbitals serrated. Small teeth in the jaws and on the vomer;
none on the palatines. Dorsal and anal spines numerous. Lateral
line interrupted.</p>
</div>

<p>The “Climbing Perch” (<i>A. scandens</i>) is generally distributed over
the Indian Region, and well known from its faculty of moving for some
distance over land, and even up inclined surfaces. In 1797 Daldorf, in
a memoir communicated to the Linnean Society of London, mentions that
in 1791 he had himself taken an Anabas in the act of ascending a palm
tree which grew near a pond. The fish had reached the height of five
feet above the water, and was going still higher. In the effort to do
this it held on to the bark of the tree by the preopercular spines,
bent its tail, and stuck in the spines of the anal; then released its
head, and, raising it, took a new hold with the preoperculum higher up.
The fish is named in the Malayan language the “Tree Climber.” It rarely
attains a length of seven inches.</p>

<p><i>Spirobranchus</i> from the Cape, and <i>Ctenopoma</i> from Tropical
Africa, represent <i>Anabas</i> in that continent.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Polyacanthus.</span>—Body compressed, oblong; operculum
without spines or serrature; cleft of the mouth small, more or

and anal, the caudal, and the ventral, more or less elongate in
mature specimens. Caudal rounded. Lateral line interrupted or
absent.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_517">[517]</span></p>

<p>This genus is represented chiefly in the East Indian Archipelago; seven
species are known; some of them have been domesticated on account of
the beauty of their colours, and several varieties have been produced.
One of them is to be mentioned, as, under the name of “Paradise-fish,”
it has been introduced into the aquaria of Europe, where it readily
breeds. It was known already to Lacépède, and has been mentioned since
his time in all ichthyological works as <i>Macropus viridi-auratus</i>.
In adult males some of the rays, and especially the caudal lobes, are
much prolonged.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Osphromenus.</span>—Body compressed, more or less elevated;
operculum without spine or serrature. Small fixed teeth in the
jaws, none on the palate. Dorsal spines in small or moderate
number; anal spines in moderate or great number; ventral fins
with the outer ray very long, filiform. Lateral line not
interrupted or absent.</p>

     <p class="p0 center smaller">Fig. 236.—Osphromenus olfax.</p>
  </div>

<p>To this genus belongs the celebrated “Gourami” (<i>Osphromenus
olfax</i>), reputed to be one of the best flavoured Freshwater-fishes
in the East-Indian Archipelago. Its original home is Java, Sumatra,
Borneo, and several other islands; but thence it has been transported
to, and acclimatised in, Penang, Malacca, Mauritius, and even Cayenne.
Being an almost omnivorous fish and tenacious of life, it seems to
recommend itself particularly for acclimatisation in other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_518">[518]</span> tropical
countries, and specimens kept in captivity become as tame as carps. It
attains the size of a large turbot. A second, but much smaller, species
of this genus, <i>O. trichopterus</i>, is frequently kept in vessels
on account of the exquisite beauty of its varying iridescent metallic
tints; like other fishes of this family it is very pugnacious.</p>

<p><i>Trichogaster</i>, a very common Bengalese fish, differs from
<i>Osphromenus</i> in having the ventral fins reduced to a single long
filament.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Betta.</span>—Body compressed, oblong; operculum without
spine or serrature. Small fixed teeth in the jaws, none on the
palate. Dorsal fin short, on the middle of the back, without any
pungent spine; anal fin long. Ventral fin with five soft rays,
the outer one being produced. Lateral line interrupted or absent.</p>
</div>

<p>A species of this genus (<i>B. pugnax</i>) is, on account of its
pugnacious habits, reared by the Siamese. Cantor gives the following
account:—“When the fish is in a state of quiet, its dull colours
present nothing remarkable; but if two be brought together, or if
one sees its own image in a looking-glass, the little creature
becomes suddenly excited, the raised fins and the whole body shine
with metallic colours of dazzling beauty, while the projected gill
membrane, waving like a black frill round the throat, adds something
of grotesqueness to the general appearance. In this state it makes
repeated darts at its real or reflected antagonist. But both, when
taken out of each other’s sight, instantly become quiet. This
description was drawn up in 1840, at Singapore, by a gentleman who had
been presented with several by the King of Siam. They were kept in
glasses of water, fed with larvæ of mosquitoes, and had thus lived for
many months. The Siamese are as infatuated with the combats of these
fish as the Malays are with their cock-fights; and stake on the issue
considerable sums, and sometimes their own persons and families. The
license to exhibit fish-fights is farmed, and brings a considerable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_519">[519]</span>
annual revenue to the King of Siam. The species abounds in the rivulets
at the foot of the hills of Penang. The inhabitants name it ‘Pla-kat,’
or the ‘Fighting-fish;’ but the kind kept especially for fighting is an
artificial variety cultivated for the purpose.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Micracanthus.</span>—This genus represents the three last-named
genera in Africa, where it has been recently discovered in tributaries
of the river Ogooué. It seems to differ from the Indian genera chiefly
by its more elongate body, the structure of the fins being scarcely
different (D. 3/7, A. 4/23, V. 1/4).</p>


<h6 class="smcap">Second Family—Luciocephalidæ.</h6>

<p><i>Body elongate, covered with scales of moderate size. Lateral line

<h5 class="smcap">Seventeenth Division—Acanthopterygii lophotiformes.</h5>

<p><i>Body riband shaped, with the vent near its extremity; a short anal
behind the vent; dorsal fin as long as the body.</i></p>

<p>Only one species is known of this division or family, <i>Lophotes
cepedianus</i>. It is most probably a deep-sea fish, but does not
descend to so great a depth as the <i>Trachypteridæ</i>, its bony and
soft parts being well coherent. It is a scarce fish, hitherto found in
the Mediterranean, off Madeira, and in the Sea of Japan; its length is
known to exceed five feet. The head is elevated into a very high crest,
and the dorsal fin commences with an exceedingly strong and long spine
on the head. Silvery, with rose-coloured fins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_520">[520]</span></p>


<h5 class="smcap">Eighteenth Division—Acanthopterygii Tæniiformes.</h5>

     <p class="p0 center smaller">Fig. 237.—Trachypterus tænia.</p>
  </div>

<p>The “Ribbon-fishes” are true deep-sea fishes, met with in all parts
of the oceans, generally found when floating dead on the surface, or
thrown ashore by the waves. Their body is like a band, specimens of
from fifteen to twenty feet long being from ten to twelve inches deep,
and about an inch or two broad at their thickest part. The eye is
large and lateral; the mouth small, armed with very feeble teeth; the
head deep and short. A high dorsal fin runs along the whole length of
the back, and is supported by extremely numerous rays; its foremost
portion, on the head, is detached from the rest of the fin, and
composed of very elongate flexible spines. The anal fin is absent. The
caudal fin (if preserved, which is rarely the case, in adult specimens)
has an extra-axial position, being directed upwards like a fan. The
ventrals are thoracic, either composed of several rays or reduced to a
single<span class="pagenum" id="Page_521">[521]</span> long filament. The coloration is generally silvery, with rosy
fins.</p>

<p>When these fishes reach the surface of the water the expansion of the
gases within their body has so loosened all parts of their muscular and
bony system, that they can be lifted out of the water with difficulty
only, and nearly always portions of the body and fins are broken and
lost. The bones contain very little bony matter, are very porous, thin
and light. At what depths Ribbon-fishes live is not known; probably
the depths vary for different species; but although none have been
yet obtained by means of the deep-sea dredge, they must be abundant
at the bottom of all oceans, as dead fishes or fragments of them
are frequently obtained. Some writers have supposed from the great
length and narrow shape of these fishes that they have been mistaken
for “Sea-serpents;” but as these monsters of the sea are always
represented by those who have had the good fortune of meeting with them
as remarkably active, it is not likely that harmless Ribbon-fishes,
which are either dying or dead, have been the objects described as
“Sea-serpents.”</p>

     <p class="p0 center smaller">Fig. 238.—Young Trachypterus.</p>
  </div>

<p>Young Ribbon-fishes (from two to four inches) are not rarely met with
near the surface; they possess the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_522">[522]</span> extraordinary development of
fin rays observed in the whole class of fishes, some of them being
several times longer than the body, and provided with lappet-like
dilatations. There is no doubt that fishes with such delicate
appendages are bred and live in depths where the water is absolutely
quiet, as a sojourn in the disturbed water of the surface would
deprive them at once of organs which must be of some utility for their
preservation.</p>

<p>Ribbon-fishes are divided into three genera:—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trachypterus.</span>—In which the ventral rays are well developed,
and composed of several more or less branched rays. Specimens of this
genus have been taken in the Mediterranean, Atlantic, at Mauritius, and
in the Eastern Pacific. The “Deal-fish” (<i>T. arcticus</i>) is often
met with in the North Atlantic, and specimens are generally found after
the equinoctial gales on the coasts of the Orkneys and North Britain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stylophorus.</span>—Without ventrals, and with the tail terminating
in an exceedingly long cord-like appendage. Known from one specimen
only, found at the beginning of this century between Cuba and
Martinique. It is eleven inches long, and preserved in the Museum of
the Royal College of Surgeons in London.</p>

<p><i>Regalecus.</i>—Each ventral fin is reduced to a long filament,
dilated at the extremity; caudal fin rudimentary or absent. These
are the largest of all Ribbon-fishes, specimens being on record the
length of which exceeded twenty feet. They have been taken in the
Mediterranean, North and South Atlantic, Indian Ocean, and on the coast
of New Zealand. They are frequently called “Kings of the herrings,”
from the erroneous notion that they accompany the shoals of herrings;
or “Oar-fishes,” from their two ventral fins, which have a dilatation
at their extremity not unlike the blade of an oar. One or more species
(<i>R. banksii</i>) are sometimes found on the British<span class="pagenum" id="Page_523">[523]</span> coasts, but
they are very scarce, not more than sixteen captures having been
recorded between the years 1759 and 1878.</p>


<h5 class="smcap">Nineteenth Division—Acanthopterygii Notacanthiformes.</h5>

<p><i>Dorsal fin short, composed of short, isolated spines, without a soft
portion. Anal fin very long, anteriorly with many spines; ventrals
abdominal, with more than five soft and several unarticulated rays.</i></p>

<p><i>Notacanthus</i> is the most aberrant type of Acanthopterygians. Of
the characteristics of this order the development of spines in the
vertical fins is the only one preserved in the fishes of this genus.
Their body is elongate, covered with very small scales; the snout
protrudes beyond the mouth. Eyes lateral, of moderate size; dentition
feeble. Five species are known from the Arctic Ocean, Mediterranean,
Atlantic, and Southern Pacific. They inhabit considerable depths,
probably from 100 to 400 fathoms, and during the “Challenger”
expedition specimens have been obtained from an alleged depth of 1875
fathoms.</p>

<p>The fishes of this family are marine; they resemble the Chætodonts
with regard to their mode of life, living chiefly in the neighbourhood
of coral formations. Like them they are beautifully coloured, the
same patterns being sometimes reproduced in members of both families,
proving that the development and distribution of colours is due to the
agencies of climate, of the surroundings and of the habits of animals.
The geographical range of the <i>Pomacentridæ</i> is co-extensive
with that of the Chætodonts, the species being most numerous in the
Indo-Pacific and Tropical Atlantic, a few extending northwards to the
Mediterranean and Japan, southwards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_525">[525]</span> to the coasts of South Australia.
They feed chiefly on small marine animals, and such as have compressed
teeth appear to feed on the small Zoophytes covering the banks, round
which these “Coral-fishes” abound. In a fossil state this family is
known from a single genus only, <i>Odonteus</i>, from Monte Bolca,
allied to <i>Heliastes</i>. The recent genera belonging to this
family are:—<i>Amphiprion</i>, <i>Premnas</i>, <i>Dascyllus</i>,
<i>Lepidozygus</i>, <i>Pomacentrus</i>, <i>Glyphidodon</i>,

  </div>

<p>The “Wrasses” are a large family of littoral fishes, very abundant in
the temperate and tropical zones, but becoming scarcer towards the
Arctic and Antarctic circles, where they disappear entirely. Many of
them are readily recognised by their thick lips, which are sometimes
internally folded, a peculiarity which has given to them the German
term of “Lip-fishes.” They feed chiefly on mollusks and crustaceans,
their dentition being admirably adapted for crushing hard substances.
Many species have a strong curved tooth at the posterior extremity of
the intermaxillary, for the purpose of pressing a shell against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_526">[526]</span> the
lateral and front teeth by which it is crushed. Other Wrasses feed on
corals, others on zoophytes; a few are herbivorous. In all Wrasses
the upper pharyngeal bones seem to be jointed to the basi-occipital;
but whilst in <i>Labrus</i> the basi-occipital is raised on each side
into a large flattish condyle, fitting into a concavity of the upper
pharyngeals, in <i>Scarus</i> the mode of articulation is reversed,
the basi-occipital having a pair of long grooves, in which the oblong
condyles of the upper pharyngeals slide forwards and backwards.
Beautiful colours prevail in this family, permanent pigmentary colours
as well as passing iridescent reflections of the scales. Some species
remain very small, others grow to a weight of fifty pounds. The larger
kinds especially are prized as food, the smaller less so.</p>

<p>Remains of Labridæ, recognised by their united pharyngeals, which
bear molar-like teeth, are not scarce in tertiary formations of
France, Germany, Italy, and England. Such remains from Monte Bolca
and the Swiss Molasse have been referred to the genus <i>Labrus</i>.
Others, <i>Nummopalatus</i> and <i>Phyllodus</i>, are allied, but
cannot be assigned, to one of the recent genera; the latter genus is
first represented in cretaceous formations of Germany. Another genus,
<i>Taurinichthys</i>, from the Miocene of France, represents the
<i>Odacina</i> of the living fauna. <i>Egertonia</i>, from the Isle
of Sheppey, differs so much from all recent Labroid genera that its
pertinence to this family appears doubtful.</p>

<p>Young “Wrasses” differ from mature specimens in having the præoperculum
serrated. The headquarters of this genus are the Mediterranean, whence
it ranges, gradually diminishing towards the north, along all the
shores of Europe. Nine species are known; British are the “Ballan
Wrasse” (<i>L. maculatus</i>), and the “Striped or Red Wrasse” or
“Cook” (<i>L. mixtus</i>). The two sexes of the latter species are very
differently coloured; the male being generally ornamented with blue
streaks, or a blackish band along the body, whilst the female has two
or three large black blotches across the back of the tail.</p>

</div>

<p>The fishes of this genus, and the three succeeding, are known by
the name of “Parrot-wrasses.” Of <i>Scarus</i> one species (<i>S.
cretensis</i>) occurs in the Mediterranean, and nine others in the
tropical Atlantic. The first was held in high repute by the ancients,
and Aristotle has several passages respecting its rumination. It was
most plentiful and of the best quality in the Carpathian Sea, between
Crete and Asia Minor, but was not unknown even in early times on the
Italian coasts, though Columella says that it seldom passed beyond
Sicily in his day. But in the reign of Claudius, according to Pliny,
Optatus Elipentius brought it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_531">[531]</span> from the Troad, and introduced it into
the sea between Ostium and Campagna. For five years all that were
caught in the nets were thrown into the sea again, and from that
time it was an abundant fish in that locality. In the time of Pliny
it was considered to be the first of fishes <i>(Nunc Scaro datur
principatus</i>); and the expense incurred by Elipentius was justified,
in the opinion of the Roman gourmands, by the extreme delicacy of the
fish. It was a fish, said the poets, whose very excrements the gods
themselves were unwilling to reject. Its flesh was tender, agreeable,
sweet, easy of digestion, and quickly assimilated; yet if it happened
to have eaten an Aplysia, it produced violent diarrhœa. In short,
there is no fish of which so much has been said by ancient writers. In
the present day the Scarus of the Archipelago is considered to be a
fish of exquisite flavour; and the Greeks still name it <i>Scaro</i>,
and eat it with a sauce made of its liver and intestines. It feeds
on fucus; and Valenciennes thinks that the necessity for masticating
its vegetable diet thoroughly, and the working of it with that intent
backwards and forwards in the mouth, may have given rise to the notion
of its being a ruminant; and it is certain that its aliment is very
finely divided when it reaches the stomach.</p>

</div>

<p>This tropical genus contains by far the greatest number of Scaroid
Wrasses, some seventy species being known, and a still greater number
of names being introduced into the various Ichthyological works. They
are beautifully coloured, but the colours change with age, and vary
in an extraordinary degree in the same species. They rapidly fade
after death, so that it is almost impossible to recognise in preserved
specimens the species described from living individuals. Many attain
to a rather large size, upwards of three feet in length. The majority
are eaten, but some acquire poisonous properties from their food, which
consists either of corals or of fucus.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Odax.</span>—The edge of each jaw is sharp, without distinct

<h6 class="smcap">Third Family—Embiotocidæ.</h6>

<p><i>Body compressed, elevated or oblong, covered with cycloid scales;
lateral line continuous. One dorsal fin, with a spinous portion, and
with a scaly sheath along the base, which is separated by a groove from
the other scales; anal with three spines and numerous rays; ventral
fins thoracic, with one spine and five rays. Small teeth in the jaws,
none on the palate. Pseudobranchiæ present. Stomach siphonal, pyloric
appendages none. Viviparous.</i></p>

<p>Marine Fishes characteristic of the fauna of the temperate North
Pacific, the majority living on the American side, and only a few
on the Asiatic. All are viviparous (see Fig. <a href="#fig70">70</a>, p. 159). Agassiz
describes the development of the embryoes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_534">[534]</span> as a normal ovarian
gestation, the sac containing the young not being the oviduct but
the ovarian sheath, which fulfils the functions of the ovary. This
organ presents two modes of arrangement: in one there is a series of
triangular membranous flaps communicating with each other, between
which the young are arranged, mostly longitudinally, the head of one
to the tail of another, but sometimes with the bodies curved, to the
number of eighteen or twenty; in the other, the cavity is divided by
three membranes converging to a point, into four compartments, not
communicating with each other except towards the genital opening, the
young being arranged in the same longitudinal manner. The proportionate
size of the young is very remarkable. In a female specimen 10½ inches
long, and 4½ inches high, the young were nearly 3 inches long and 1
inch high. Seventeen species are known, the majority of which belong to
<i>Ditrema</i>, and one to <i>Hysterocarpus</i>. They do not attain to
a large size, varying from three-quarters to three pounds in weight.</p>

<p>The family of “Cod-fishes” consists partly of littoral and surface
species (and they form the majority), partly of deep-sea forms. The
former are almost entirely confined to the temperate zones, extending
beyond the Arctic Circle; the latter have, as deep-sea fishes
generally, a much wider range, and hitherto have been found chiefly at
considerable depths of rather low latitudes. Only two or three species
inhabit fresh waters. They form one of the most important articles of
food and subsistence to the fishermen in Europe and North America, and
to whole tribes bordering upon the Arctic Ocean.</p>

<p>Fossil remains are scarce. <i>Nemopteryx</i> and <i>Palæogadus</i> have
been described from the schists of Glaris, a formation believed to have
been the bottom of a very deep sea. In the clay of Sheppey species
occur allied to <i>Gadus</i>, <i>Merluccius</i>, and <i>Phycis</i>;
others, not readily determinable, have been found at Licata in Sicily
(Miocene).</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Gadus.</span>—Body moderately elongate, covered with small
scales. A separate caudal, three dorsal, and two anal fins;
ventrals narrow, composed of six or more rays. Teeth in the
upper jaw in a narrow band; vomerine teeth; none on the
palatines.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_540">[540]</span></p>

<p>Arctic and temperate zones of the Northern Hemisphere. Eighteen species
are known, of which the following are the most important:—</p>

<p><i>Gadus morrhua</i>, the common “Cod-fish”—in German called
“Kabeljau” when fresh and old, “Dorsch” when young and fresh,
“Stock-fish” when dried, “Labberdan” when salted—measures from two
to four feet, and attains to a weight of one hundred pounds. On the
British coasts and in the German Ocean it is generally of a greenish or
brownish-olive colour, with numerous yellowish or brown spots. Farther
northwards darker-coloured specimens, frequently without any spots,
predominate; and on the Greenland, Iceland, and North Scandinavian
coasts the Cod have often a large irregular black blotch on the side.
The Cod-fish occurs between 50° and 75° lat. N., in great profusion,
to a depth of 120 fathoms, but is not found nearer the Equator than
40° lat. Close to the coast it is met with singly all the year round,
but towards the spawning-time it approaches the shore in numbers,
which happens in January in England and not before May on the American
coasts. The English resorted to the cod-fisheries of Iceland before
the year 1415, but since the sixteenth century most vessels go to
the banks of Newfoundland, and almost all the preserved Cod consumed
during Lent in the various continental countries is imported from
across the Atlantic. At one time the Newfoundland cod-fishery rivalled
in importance the whale-fishery and the fur trade of North America.
Cod-liver oil is prepared from the liver on the Norwegian coast, but
also other species of this genus contribute to this most important drug.</p>

<p><i>Gadus tomcodus</i> abundantly occurs on the American coasts; it
remains within smaller dimensions than the common Cod-fish. <i>Gadus
æglefinus</i>, the “Haddock” (“Schell-fisch” of the Germans, “Hadot” of
the French), is distinguished by a black lateral line and a blackish
spot above the pectoral fin. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_541">[541]</span> attains to a length of three feet in
the higher latitudes, but remains smaller on more southern coasts;
like the Cod it extends across the Atlantic. The largest specimens are
taken on the British coast in winter, because at that time they leave
the deep water to spawn on the coast. <i>Gadus merlangus</i>, the
“Whiting,” with a black spot in the axil of the pectoral fin. <i>Gadus
luscus</i>, the “Bib,” “Pout,” or “Whiting-pout,” with cross-bands
during life, and with a black axillary spot, rarely exceeding a weight
of five pounds. <i>Gadus fabricii</i>, a small species, but occurring
in incredible numbers on the shores near the Arctic circle, and ranging
to 80° lat. N. <i>Gadus pollachius</i>, the “Pollack,” without a barbel
at the chin, and with the lower jaw projecting beyond the upper.
<i>Gadus virens</i>, the “Coal-fish,” valuable on account of its size
and abundance, and therefore preserved for export like the Cod.</p>

<p>The fishes of the genus <i>Gadus</i> are bathymetrically succeeded by
several genera, as <i>Gadiculus</i>, <i>Mora</i>, and <i>Strinsia</i>;
however these do not descend to sufficiently great depths to be
included into the deep-sea Fauna; the two following are true deep-sea
fishes.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Halargyreus.</span>—Body elongate, covered with small scales.
Two dorsal and two anal fins; ventrals composed of several rays.
Jaws with a band of minute villiform teeth; vomer and palatines
toothless. No barbel.</p>
</div>

<p>The single species known, <i>H. johnsonii</i>, proves to be a deep-sea
fish by its organisation as well as geographical distribution.
Originally known from a single specimen, which was obtained at Madeira,
it has since been found off the coast of New Zealand. There is no doubt
that it will be discovered also in intermediate seas.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Melanonus.</span>—Head and body rather compressed, covered
with cycloid scales of moderate size, and terminating in a long
tapering tail, without caudal. Eye of moderate size. Villiform
teeth in the jaws, on the vomer and palatine bones. Barbel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_542">[542]</span>
none. A short anterior dorsal, the second extending to the end
of the tail, and the anal being of similar length. Ventrals
composed of several rays. Bones soft and flexible.</p>
</div>

<p>This is one of the discoveries made during the expedition of the
“Challenger.” The single specimen obtained is of a deep-black colour,
and was dredged up at a depth of 1975 fathoms in the Antarctic Ocean.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Merluccius.</span>—Body elongate, covered with very small
scales. A separate caudal; two dorsal fins and one anal;
ventrals well developed, composed of seven rays. Teeth in the
jaws and on the vomer rather strong, in double or triple series.
No barbel.</p>
</div>

<p>Two species are known of this genus, widely separated in their
distribution. The European species, <i>M. vulgaris</i>, the “Hake,”
is found on both sides of the Atlantic, and grows to a length of four
feet. It is caught in great numbers, and preserved as “Stock-fish.” The
second species <i>M. gayi</i>, is common in the Straits of Magelhæn and
on the coast of Chili, less so in New Zealand.</p>

<p>The vertebral column of this genus shows a singular modification of
the apophyses. The neural spines of all the abdominal vertebræ are
extremely strong, dilated, wedged into one another. The parapophyses
of the third to sixth vertebræ are slender, styliform, whilst those of
all the following abdominal vertebræ are very long and broad, convex on
the upper and concave on the lower surface; the two or three anterior
pairs are, as it were, inflated. The whole forms a strong roof for the
air-bladder, reminding us of a similar structure in <i>Kurtus</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Pseudophycis.</span>—Body of moderate length, covered with
rather small scales. A separate caudal, two dorsals, and one
anal; ventral fins very narrow and styliform, but composed
of several rays. Jaws with a band of small teeth; vomer and
palatines toothless. Chin with a barbel.</p>
</div>

<p>Two species, of which <i>Ps. bachus</i> is common on the coast of New
Zealand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_543">[543]</span></p>

<p>Allied genera are <i>Lotella</i>, <i>Physiculus</i>, <i>Uraleptus</i>,
and <i>Læmonema</i>, from moderate depths, obtained chiefly off Madeira
and the Southern Temperate Zone.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Phycis.</span>—Body of moderate length, covered with small
scales. Fins more or less enveloped in loose skin. A separate
caudal; two dorsal fins and one anal; the anterior dorsal
composed of from eight to ten rays; ventrals reduced to a single
long ray, bifid at its end. Small teeth in the jaws and on the
vomer; palatine bones toothless. Chin with a barbel.</p>
</div>

<p>Six species from the temperate parts of the North Atlantic and the
Mediterranean, one, <i>Ph. blennioides</i>, is occasionally found on
the British coast.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Haloporphyrus.</span>—Body elongate, covered with small
scales. A separate caudal, two dorsal fins, and one anal; the
first dorsal with four rays; ventrals narrow, composed of six
rays. Jaws and vomer with villiform teeth; palatine bones
toothless. Chin with a barbel.</p>
</div>

<p>A small genus of deep-sea fishes, of which three species are known.
They offer a striking instance of the extraordinary distribution of
deep-sea fishes; <i>H. lepidion</i> occurs in from 100 to 600 fathoms
in the Mediterranean and the neighbouring parts of the Atlantic, off
the coast of Japan, and various parts of the South Atlantic; <i>H.
australis</i> in from 55 to 70 fathoms in the Straits of Magelhæn; and
finally <i>H. rostratus</i> in from 600 to 1375 fathoms, midway between
the Cape of Good Hope and Kerguelen’s Land, and in the South Atlantic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_544">[544]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Lota.</span>—Body elongate, covered with very small scales. A
separate caudal, two dorsal fins, and one anal; ventrals narrow,
composed of six rays. Villiform teeth in the jaws and on the
vomer; none on the palatines. The first dorsal with from ten to
thirteen well-developed rays. Chin with a barbel.</p>
</div>

<p>The “Burbot,” or “Eel-pout” (<i>L. vulgaris</i>, Fig. <a href="#fig8">8</a>, p. 43),
is a Freshwater-fish which never enters salt water. It is locally
distributed in Central and Northern Europe and North America; it is one
of the best Freshwater-fishes, and exceeds a length of three feet.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Molva.</span>—Differs from Lota in having several large teeth
in the lower jaw and on the vomer.</p>
</div>

<p>The “Ling” (<i>M. vulgaris</i>) is a very valuable species, common on
the northern coasts of Europe, Iceland, and Greenland; and generally
found from three to four feet long. The larger number of the specimens
caught are cured and dried.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Motella.</span>—Body elongate, covered with minute scales.
A separate caudal. Two dorsal fins, the anterior of which is
reduced to a narrow rayed fringe, more or less concealed in a
longitudinal groove; the first ray is prolonged. One anal fin.
Ventrals composed of from five to seven rays. A band of teeth in
the jaws and on the vomer.</p>
</div>

<p>Eight species of “Rocklings” are known from the coasts of Europe,
Iceland, Greenland, Japan, the Cape of Good Hope, and New Zealand. They
are of small size, and chiefly distinguished by the number of their
barbels. British are the Five-bearded Rockling (<i>M. mustela</i>), the
Three-bearded Rocklings (<i>M. tricirrhata</i>, <i>macrophthalma</i>,
and <i>maculata</i>), and the Four-bearded Rockling (<i>M.
cimbria</i>). <i>M. macrophthalma</i> comes from a depth of from 80 to
180 fathoms. The young are known as “Mackerel Midge” (<i>Couchia</i>),
and sometimes met with in large numbers at some distance from the coast.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Raniceps.</span>—Head large, broad, and depressed; body
of moderate length, covered with minute scales. A separate
caudal.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_545">[545]</span> Two dorsal fins, the anterior of which is very short,
rudimentary. One anal fin. Ventrals composed of six rays.
Cardlike teeth in the jaws and on the vomer.</p>
</div>

<p>The “Trifurcated Hake,” <i>R. trifurcus</i>, not uncommon on the coasts
of Northern Europe.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Bregmaceros.</span>—Body fusiform, compressed posteriorly,
covered with cycloid scales of moderate size. Two dorsal fins;
the anterior reduced to a single long ray on the occiput; the
second and the anal much depressed in the middle; ventrals very
long, composed of five rays. Teeth small.</p>

<p>A dwarf Gadoid, the only one found at the surface between the Tropics.
<i>B. macclellandii</i> scarcely exceeds three inches in length, is not
uncommon in the Indian Ocean, and has found its way to New Zealand;
specimens have been picked up in mid-ocean.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Murænolepis.</span>—Body covered with lanceolate epidermoid
productions, intersecting each other at right angles like those
of a Freshwater-eel. Vertical fins confluent, no caudal being
discernible; an anterior dorsal fin is represented by a single
filamentous ray; ventral fins narrow, composed of several rays.
A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_546">[546]</span> barbel. Jaws with a band of villiform teeth; palate toothless.</p>
</div>

<p>One species (<i>M. marmoratus</i>) from Kerguelen’s Land.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Chiasmodus.</span>—Body naked; stomach and abdomen
distensible. Two dorsal fins and one anal; a separate caudal;
ventral fins rather narrow, with several rays. Upper and lower
jaws with two series of large pointed teeth, some of the
anterior being very large and movable; teeth on the palatine
bones, but none on the vomer. Chin without barbel.</p>
</div>

<p>This Gadoid (<i>Ch. niger</i>, Fig. <a href="#fig111">111</a>, p. 311), inhabits great depths
in the Atlantic (to 1500 fathoms). The specimen figured was taken with
a large Scopeloid in its stomach.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Brosmius.</span>—Body moderately elongate, covered with very
small scales. A separate caudal, one dorsal, and one anal;

<p>The “Torsk” (<i>B. brosme</i>) is confined to the northern parts of the
temperate zone, and probably extends to the arctic circle.</p>


<h6 class="smcap">Third Family—Ophidiidæ.</h6>

<p><i>Body more or less elongate, naked, or scaly. Vertical fins generally
united; no separate anterior dorsal or anal; dorsal occupying the
greater portion of the back. Ventral fins rudimentary or absent,
jugular. Gill-openings wide, the gill-membranes not attached to the
isthmus.</i></p>

<p>Marine fishes (with the exception of <i>Lucifuga</i>), partly littoral,
partly bathybial. They may be divided into five groups.</p>

<p>I. <i>Ventral fins present, attached to the humeral arch</i>:
<span class="smcap">Brotulina</span>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Brotula.</span>—Body elongate, covered with minute scales.
Eye of moderate size. Each ventral reduced to a single filament,
sometimes bifid at its extremity. Teeth villiform; snout with
barbels. One pyloric appendage.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_547">[547]</span></p>

<p>Five species of small size from the Tropical Atlantic and Indian Ocean.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="fig250" style="max-width: 539px">

<p><i>Lucifuga</i> are <i>Brotula</i> organised for a subterranean life.
The eye is absent, or quite rudimentary, and covered by the skin; the
barbels of Brotula are replaced by numerous minute ciliæ or tubercles.
They inhabit the subterranean waters of caves in Cuba, and never come
to the light.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Bathynectes.</span>—Body produced into a long tapering tail,
without caudal. Mouth very wide, villiform teeth in the jaws, on
the vomer and palatine bones. Barbel none. Ventral fins reduced
to simple or bifid filaments, placed close together, and near to
the humeral symphysis. Gill-membranes not united; gill-laminæ
remarkably short. Bones of the head soft and cavernous;
operculum with a very feeble spine above.</p>
</div>

<p>Deep-sea fishes, inhabiting depths varying from 1000 to 2500 fathoms.
Three species are known, the largest specimen obtained being seventeen

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Typhlonus.</span>—Head large, compressed, with most of the

Guinea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_549">[549]</span></p>

<p>Of the remaining genera belonging to this group, <i>Brotulophis</i>,
<i>Halidesmus</i>, <i>Dinematichthys</i>, and <i>Bythites</i> are
surface forms; <i>Sirembo</i> and <i>Pteridium</i> inhabit moderate

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Ophidium.</span>—Body elongate, compressed, covered with very

<p>Small fishes from the Atlantic and Pacific. Seven species are known,
differing from one another in the structure of the air-bladder (see p.
145).</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Genypterus</span> is a larger form of <i>Ophidium</i>, in
which the outer series of teeth in the jaws and the single
palatine series contains strong teeth.</p>
</div>

<p>Three species from the Cape of Good Hope, South Australia, New Zealand,
and Chili are known. They grow to a length of five feet, and have an
excellent flesh, like cod, well adapted for curing. At the Cape they
are known by the name of “Klipvisch,” and in New Zealand as “Ling” or
“Cloudy Bay Cod.”</p>

<p>III. <i>No ventral fins whatever; vent at the throat</i>:
<span class="smcap">Fierasferina</span>.</p>

<p>These fishes (<i>Fierasfer</i> and <i>Encheliophis</i>) are of very
small size and eel-like in shape; the ten species known are found in
the Mediterranean, Atlantic, and Indo-Pacific. As far as is known they
live parasitically in cavities of other marine animals, accompany
Medusæ, and more especially penetrate into the respiratory cavities of
Star-fishes and Holothurians. Not rarely they attempt other animals
less suited for their habits, as, for instance, Bivalves; and cases are
known in which they have been found imprisoned below the mantle of the
Mollusk, or covered over with a layer of the pearly substance secreted
by it. They are perfectly harmless to their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_550">[550]</span> host, and merely seek for
themselves a safe habitation, feeding on the animalcules which enter
with the water the cavity inhabited by them.</p>

<p>IV. <i>No ventral fins whatever; vent remote from the head;
gill-openings very wide, the gill-membranes not being united</i>:
<span class="smcap">Ammodytina</span>.</p>

<p>The “Sand-eels” or “Launces” (<i>Ammodytes</i>) are extremely common
on sandy shores of Europe and North America. They live in large
shoals, rising as with one accord to the surface, or diving to the
bottom, where they bury themselves with incredible rapidity in the
sand. They are much sought after for bait by fishermen, who discover
their presence on the surface by watching the action of Porpoises
which feed on them. These Cetaceans, when they meet with a shoal, know
how to keep it on the surface by diving below and swimming round it,
thus destroying large numbers of them. The most common species on the
British coast is the Lesser Sand-eel (<i>A. tobianus</i>); the Greater
Sand-eel (<i>A. lanceolatus</i>), which attains to a length of eighteen
inches; <i>A. siculus</i>, from the Mediterranean, scarcer in British
seas. Two species live on the American coasts, <i>A. americanus</i>
and <i>A. dubius</i>; one in California, <i>A. personatus</i>.
<i>Bleekeria</i> from Madras is the second genus of this group.</p>

<p>This family, known a few years ago from a limited number of examples,
representing a few species only, proves to be one which is distributed
over all oceans, occurring in considerable variety and great abundance
at depths of from 120 to 2600 fathoms. They are, in fact, Deep-sea
Gadoids, much resembling each other in the general shape of their body,
but differing in the form of the snout and in the structure of their
scales. About forty species are known, of which many attain a length of
three feet. They have been referred to the following genera:—</p>

<h5 class="smcap">Second Division—Anacanthini Pleuronectoidei.</h5>

<p><i>Head and part of the body unsymmetrically formed.</i></p>

<p>This division consists of one family only:</p>


<h6 class="smcap">Pleuronectidæ.</h6>

<p>The fishes of this family are called “Flat-fishes,” from their strongly
compressed, high, and flat body; in consequence of the absence of
an air-bladder, and of the structure of their paired fins, they are
unable to maintain their body in a vertical position, resting and
moving on one side of the body only. The side turned towards the
bottom is sometimes the left, sometimes the right, colourless, and
termed the “blind” side; that turned upwards and towards the light
is variously, and in some tropical species even vividly, coloured.
Both eyes are on the coloured side, on which side also the muscles
are more strongly developed. The dorsal and anal fins are exceedingly
long, without division. All the Flat-fishes undergo remarkable
changes with age, which, however, are very imperfectly known and not
yet fully understood, from the difficulty of referring larval forms
to their respective parents. The larvæ are, singularly enough, much
more frequently met in the open ocean than near the coast; they are
transparent, like <i>Leptocephali</i>; perfectly symmetrical, with an
eye on each side of the head, and swim in a vertical position like
other fishes. The manner in which one eye is transferred from the blind
to the coloured side is subject to discussion. Whilst some naturalists
believe that the eye turning round its axis pushes its way through the
yielding bones from the blind to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_554">[554]</span> upper side, others hold that, as
soon as the body of the fish commences to rest on one side only, the
eye of that side, in its tendency to turn towards the light, carries
the surrounding parts of the head with it; in fact, the whole of the
fore-part of the head is twisted towards the coloured side, which is a
process of but little difficulty as long as the framework of the head
is still cartilaginous.</p>

<p>Flat-fishes when adult live always on the bottom, and swim with an
undulating motion of their body. Sometimes they rise to the surface;
they prefer sandy bottom, and do not descend to any considerable depth.
They occur in all seas, except in the highest latitudes and on rocky,
precipitous coasts, becoming most numerous towards the equator; those
of the largest size occur in the temperate zone. Some enter fresh water
freely, and others have become entirely acclimatised in ponds and
rivers. All are carnivorous.</p>

<p>Flat-fishes were not abundant in the tertiary epoch; the only
representative known is a species of <i>Rhombus</i> from Monte Bolca.</p>

<p>The size and abundance of Flat-fishes, and the flavour of the flesh of
the majority of the species, render this family one of the most useful
to man; and especially on the coasts of the northern temperate zone,
their capture is one of the most important sources of profit to the
fishermen.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Psettodes.</span>—Mouth very wide, the maxillary being more

<p>To complete the list of Pleuronectoid genera, the following<span class="pagenum" id="Page_559">[559]</span> have
to be mentioned: <i>Soleotalpa</i> and <i>Apionichthys</i>, Soles

latter genus having the lips provided with tentacles.</p>


<h4 class="smcap">Fourth Order—Physostomi.</h4>

<p><i>All the fin-rays articulated, only the first of the dorsal and
pectoral fins is sometimes ossified. Ventral fins, if present,
abdominal, without spine. Air-bladder, if present, with a pneumatic
duct (except in Scombresocidæ).</i></p>


<h6 class="smcap">First Family—Siluridæ.</h6>

<p><i>Skin naked or with osseous scutes, but without scales. Barbels
always present; maxillary bone rudimentary, almost always forming a
support to a maxillary barbel. Margin of the upper jaw formed by the
intermaxillaries only. Suboperculum absent. Air-bladder generally
present, communicating with the organ of hearing by means of the
auditory ossicles. Adipose fin present or absent.</i></p>

<p>A large family, represented by numerous genera, which exhibit a great
variety of form and structure of the fins; they inhabit the fresh
waters of all the temperate and tropical regions; a few enter the sea
but keep near the coast. The first appearance of Siluroids is indicated
by some fossil remains in tertiary deposits of the highlands of Padang
in Sumatra, where <i>Pseudeutropius</i> and <i>Bagarius</i>, types well
represented in the living Indian fauna, have been found. Also in North
America spines referable to Cat-fishes have been found in tertiary
formations.</p>

<p>The skeleton of the typical Siluroids shows many peculiarities. The
cranial cavity is not membranous on the sides,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_560">[560]</span> but closed as in the
Cyprinidæ, by the orbitosphenoids and the ethmoid that unite with
the prefrontals, carrying forward the cranial cavity to the nasal
bone, without leaving a membranous septum between the orbits. But the
supraoccipital is greatly developed, and in many the post-temporal is
united by suture to the sides of the cranium. In numerous members of
the family the skull is enlarged posteriorly, by dermal ossifications,
to form a kind of helmet which spreads over the nape; the lateral
angles of this production are formed by the suprascapulæ, augmented
and fixed by suture, and the median part is the extension of the
supraoccipital, which is generally very large, is connected anteriorly
with the frontal, and passing backwards between the postfrontals, the
parietals, the mastoids, and the suprascapulæ, goes past them all on
to the nape. The mastoids interpose between the postfrontals and the
parietals, so as to come in contact with the supraoccipital, and the
parietals but little developed are pressed to the back part of the
cranium, and in some instances wholly disappear.</p>

<p>The suprascapula most frequently unites to the mastoid by an immovable
suture, which includes the parietal when that bone is present, and
extends even to the supraoccipital. It gives out besides two processes,
one of them resting on the exoccipital and basi-occipital, or wedging
itself between them, and the other going to the first vertebra;
sometimes a plate from the exoccipital supports the same vertebra. This
vertebra, though it presents a pretty continuous centrum beneath, is in
reality composed of three or four coalescent vertebræ, as we ascertain
by its diapophyses, by the circular elevations of the neural canal, and
by the holes for the exit of the pairs of spinal nerves. There is great
variety in the development of the various processes of the bones we
have mentioned, and there is no less in the magnitude and connections
of the first three interneurals.</p>

<p>In general in the species which have a strong dorsal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_561">[561]</span> spine the second
and third interneurals unite to form a single plate, the “buckler;” the
great spine is articulated to the third interneural, and there is only
the vestige of a spine on the second interneural in form of a small
oval bone, forked below, whose function is to act as a bolt or fulcrum
to the great spine when the fish wishes to use it as an offensive
weapon. The great spine itself is joined by a ring to a second spine,
which belongs to the third interneural. This articulation by ring
exists in Lophius and a few other fishes not of this family.</p>

<p>The first interneural does not carry a ray, and it varies much in
the species whose helmet is continuous with the buckler, as in
many of the Bagri and Pimelodi. In these cases the supraoccipital,
extending backwards, conceals the first interneural, passing over it
to touch with its point the buckler formed by the second and third
interneurals. In other instances, as in Synodontis and Auchenipterus,
the supraoccipital and second interneural, forking and expanding,
inclose and join themselves to the first interneural, but leave a
larger or smaller space in the middle of the nuchal armour which they
contribute to form. When the point of the supraoccipital does not reach
quite to the second interneural, the first interneural remains free
from connection, and occasionally shows as a narrow plate interposed
between the other two; in such a case the helmet is not continuous with
the buckler.</p>

<p>The neural spines of the coalescent centra, which form the
apparently single first vertebra, concur also in sustaining the
nuchal plate-armour and the first great dorsal spine. They carry the
interneurals, are joined to them by suture, and one of them is often
inclined towards the occiput to assist in sustaining the head; in fact,
this part of the skeleton is constructed to give firm mutual support.</p>

<p>The shoulder-girdle of the Siluroids is also formed to give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_562">[562]</span>
resistance to the strong weapon with which it is frequently armed. The
post-temporal, as we have said above, is often united by suture to the
cranium, and it obtains support below by one or two processes that
are fixed on the basioccipitals and on the diapophysis of the first
vertebra.</p>

<p>In most osseous fishes the clavicle completes the lower key of the
scapular arch in joining its fellow by suture or synchondrosis without
the intervention of the coracoid; but in the Siluroids the coracoid
descends to take part in this joint, and sometimes even to occupy the
half of the suture, which is not unfrequently constructed of very deep
interlocking serratures. The solidity of this base of the pectoral
spine is further augmented by the intimate union of the coracoid
and scapula, which often extends to junction by suture, or even to
coalescence; and these bones, moreover, give off two bony arches—the
first a slender one, arising from the salient edge of the coracoid
near the pectoral fin, and going to the interior face of the scapular
that is applied to the interior surface of the ascending branch of the
clavicle; the second and broader supplementary arch is often perforated
by a large hole; it also emanates from the same salient edge of the
radius, but proceeds in opposite direction to the inferior edge of the
clavicle, a little before the insertion of the pectoral spine. The two
arches give attachments to the muscles that move this spine; in the
Synodontes and many Bagri the upper arch remains in a cartilaginous or
ligamentous condition, while in Malapterurus it is the lower arch that
does not ossify, but both are fully formed in the Siluri and many other
Siluroids more closely allied to that typical genus. The postclavicle
is also wanting in the Siluroids. The pterygoid and entopterygoid are
reduced to a single bone, the symplectic is wholly wanting, and the
palatine is merely a slender cylindrical bone. The sub-operculum is
likewise constantly absent in all the Siluroids.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_563">[563]</span></p>

<p>The great number of different generic types has necessitated a further
division of this family into eight subdivisions:</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">Siluridæ Homalopteræ.</span>—<i>The dorsal and anal fins are
very long, nearly equal in extent to the corresponding parts of the
vertebral column.</i></p>


<p class="center p1"><i>a</i>. <span class="smcap">Clariina.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Clarias.</span>—Dorsal fin extending from the neck to the
caudal, without adipose division. Cleft of the mouth transverse,
anterior, of moderate width; barbels eight; one pair of nasal,
one of maxillary, and two pairs of mandibulary barbels. Eyes
small. Head depressed; its upper and lateral parts are osseous,
or covered with only a very thin skin. A dendritic accessory
branchial organ is attached to the convex side of the second and
fourth branchial arches, and received in a cavity behind the
gill-cavity proper. Ventrals six-rayed; only the pectoral has a
pungent spine. Body eel-like.</p>
</div>

<p>Twenty species from Africa, the East Indies, and the intermediate parts
of Asia; some attain to a length of six feet. They inhabit muddy and
marshy waters; the physiological function of the accessory branchial
organ is not known. Its skeleton is formed by a soft cartilaginous
substance covered by mucous membrane, in which the vessels are
imbedded. The vessels arise from branchial arteries, and return the
blood into branchial veins. The vernacular name of the Nilotic species
is “Carmoot.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Heterobranchus</span> differs from <i>Clarias</i> only in the
structure of the dorsal fin, the posterior portion of which is
adipose.</p>
</div>

<p>The geographical range of this genus is not quite co-extensive with
that of <i>Clarias</i>, inasmuch as it is limited to Africa and the
East-Indian Archipelago. Six species.</p>


<p class="center p1"><i>b</i>. <span class="smcap">Plotosina.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Plotosus.</span>—A short dorsal fin in front, with a pungent

anal. Vomerine teeth molar-like. Barbels eight or ten; one
immediately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_564">[564]</span> before the posterior nostril, which is remote from
the anterior, the latter being quite in front of the snout.
Cleft of the mouth transverse. Eyes small. The gill-membranes
are not confluent with the skin of the isthmus. Ventral fins
many-rayed. Head depressed; body elongate.</p>

white longitudinal bands, and is one of the most generally distributed
and common Indian fishes.—<i>Copidoglanis</i> and <i>Cnidoglanis</i>
are two very closely allied forms, chiefly from rivers and brackish
waters of Australia. None of these Siluroids attain to a considerable
size. <i>Chaca</i>, from the East Indies, belongs likewise to this

<p>II. <span class="smcap">Siluridæ Heteropteræ.</span>—<i>The rayed dorsal fin is very
little developed, and, if it is present, it belongs to the abdominal
portion of the vertebral column; the adipose fin is exceedingly small
or absent. The extent of the anal is not much inferior to that of
the caudal vertebral column. The gill-membranes overlap the isthmus,
remaining more or less separate</i>: <span class="smcap">Silurina</span>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Saccobranchus.</span>—Adipose fin none; dorsal very short,
without pungent spine, placed above the ventrals. Cleft of the
mouth transverse, anterior, of moderate width; barbels eight.
Eyes rather small. The upper and lateral parts of the head
osseous or covered with a very thin skin. Gill-cavity with an
accessory posterior sac, extending backwards between the muscles
along each side of the abdominal and caudal portions of the
vertebral column. Ventrals six-rayed.</p>
</div>

<p>Small fishes from East Indian rivers; four species are known. The
lung-like extension of the branchial cavity receives water, and is
surrounded by contractile transverse muscular fibres by which the water
is expelled at intervals. The vessels of the sac take their origin in
the last branchial artery, and pass into the aorta.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Silurus.</span>—No adipose fin; one very short dorsal,
without pungent spine. Barbels four or six, one to each
maxillary, and one or two to each mandible. Nostrils remote from
each other. Head and body covered with soft skin. The eye is
situated above the level of the angle of the mouth. The dorsal
fin is anterior to the ventrals which are composed of more than
eight rays. Caudal rounded.</p>
</div>

<p>This genus, of which five species are known, inhabits the temperate
parts of Europe and Asia. The species which has given the name to the
whole family, is the “Wels” of the Germans, <i>Silurus glanis</i>. It
is found in the fresh waters east of the Rhine, and is, besides the
Sturgeons, the largest of European Freshwater-fishes, and the only
species of this family which occurs in Europe. Barbels six. It attains
to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_566">[566]</span> a weight of 300 or 400 lbs., and the flesh, especially of smaller
specimens, is firm, flaky, and well flavoured. Aristotle described it
under the name of <i>Glanis</i>. Its former occurrence in Scotland has
justly been denied. In China it is represented by a similar species,
<i>S. asotus</i>, which, however, has four barbels only.</p>

<p>Of all Siluroid genera this has the greatest number of species

some of the species prefer brackish to fresh water, and a few enter
the sea, but keep near to the coast. Some of the species are of
small size, whilst others exceed a length of five feet. The extent
of the armature of the neck and the dentition vary much in the
different species, and affords two of the principal characters by
which the species are separated.—The following genera are allied to

Barbels eight, of which one pair is placed between the anterior

with a thoracic adhesive apparatus between, which is formed by
longitudinal plaits of the skin.</p>

<p>This fish (<i>Eu. coum</i>) inhabits the river Coic in Syria, and is
about twelve inches long. The plaited structure on the thorax probably
increases the capability of the fish of maintaining its position
in the rapid current of the stream, a function which appears to be
chiefly performed by the horizontally expanded pectoral fins. A similar
structure is found in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_572">[572]</span> <i>Glyptosternum</i>, a genus represented by
eight species in mountain streams of the East Indies, and differing

<p class="center p1"><i>a</i>. <span class="smcap">Doradina.</span></p>

<p>Some of the genera have no bony shields along the lateral line,
and a small adipose fin or none whatever; all of these are South
American—<i>Ageniosus</i>, <i>Tetranematichthys</i>, <i>Euanemus</i>,
<i>Auchenipterus</i>, <i>Glanidium</i>, <i>Centromochlus</i>,
<i>Trachelyopterus</i>, <i>Cetopsis</i>, and <i>Astrophysus</i>.</p>

<p>Others have a series of bony scutes along the middle of the side;
they form the genus <i>Doras</i> with two closely allied forms,
<i>Oxydoras</i> and <i>Rhinodoras</i>. Some twenty-five species are
known, all from rivers of tropical America, flowing into the Atlantic.
These fishes have excited attention by their habit of travelling,
during the dry season, from a piece of water about to dry up, in quest
of a pond of greater capacity. These journeys are occasionally of such
a length that the fish spends whole nights on the way, and the bands of
scaly travellers are sometimes so large that the Indians who happen to
meet them, fill many baskets of the prey thus placed in their hands.
The Indians supposed that the fish carry a supply of water with them,
but they have no special organs, and can only do so by closing the
gill-openings, or by retaining a little water between the plates of
their bodies, as Hancock supposes. The same naturalist adds that they
make regular nests, in which they cover up their eggs with care and
defend them, male and female uniting in this parental duty until the
eggs are hatched. The nest is constructed at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_573">[573]</span> the beginning of the
rainy season, of leaves, and is sometimes placed in a hole scooped out
in the beach.</p>

<p>The “Electric Cat- or Sheath-fishes” are not uncommon in the fresh
waters of tropical Africa; three species have been described, of which
<i>M. electricus</i> occurs in the Nile; they grow to a length of about
four feet. Although the first dorsal fin is absent, its position (if it
had been developed) is indicated by a rudimentary interneural spine,
which rests in the cleft of the neural process of the first vertebra.
The electric organ extends over the whole body, but is thickest on the
abdomen; it lies between two aponeurotic membranes, below the skin, and
consists of rhomboidal cells which contain a rather firm gelatinous
substance. The electric nerve takes its origin from the spinal chord,
does not enter into connection with ganglia, and consists of a single
enormously-strong primitive fibre, which distributes its branches in
the electric organ.</p>

<p>These small Siluroids, which are called “Preñadillas” by the
natives, together with the allied <i>Arges</i>, <i>Brontes</i>, and
<i>Astroplebus</i>, have received some notoriety through Humboldt’s
accounts, who adopted the popular belief that they live in subterranean
waters within the bowels of the active volcanoes of the Andes, and
are ejected with streams of mud and water during eruptions. Humboldt
himself considers it very singular that they are not cooked and
destroyed whilst they are vomited forth from craters or other openings.
The explanation of their appearance during volcanic eruptions is, that
they abound in the numerous lakes and torrents of the Andes, that they
are killed by the sulphuretted gases escaping during an eruption, and
swept down by the torrents of water issuing from the volcano.</p>

</div>

<p>This very singular form is one of the discoveries of the “Challenger;”
it is widely distributed over the seas of the Southern Hemisphere, in
depths varying from 520 to 2600 fathoms. The elongate pectoral rays
are most probably organs of touch. Four species were discovered, the
largest specimen being thirteen inches long.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Harpodon.</span>—Body elongate, covered with very thin,
diaphanous, deciduous scales. Head thick, with very short snout;
its bones are very soft, and the superficial ones are modified
into wide muciferous cavities; the lateral canal of the body
is also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_584">[584]</span> very wide, and a pair of pores corresponds to each
scale of the lateral line, one being above, the other below
the scale. Cleft of the mouth very wide; intermaxillary very
long, styliform, tapering; maxillary absent. Teeth card-like,
recurved, unequal in size; the largest are in the lower jaw,
and provided with a single barb at the posterior margin of the
point. Eye small. Ventral fins long, nine-rayed, inserted below
the anterior dorsal rays; dorsal fin in the middle of the length
of the body; adipose fin small; anal of moderate length; caudal
fin three-lobed, the lateral line being continued along the
central lobe. Centre of the vertebræ open in the middle.</p>
</div>

<p>Two species only are known of this singular genus; both are evidently
inhabitants of considerable depths, and periodically come nearer to the
surface. One (<i>H. nehereus</i>) is well known in the East Indies,
being of excellent flavour. When newly taken its body is brilliantly
phosphorescent. When salted and dry it is known under the names
of “Bombay-ducks” or “Bummaloh,” and exported in large quantities
from Bombay and the coast of Malabar. The second species (<i>H.
microchir</i>) exceeds the other in length, and has been found in the
sea off Japan.</p>

  </div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Scopelus.</span>—Body oblong, more or less compressed,
covered with large scales. Series of phosphorescent spots run
along the lower side of the body, and a similar glandular
substance sometimes occupies the front of the snout and the
back of the tail. Cleft of the mouth very wide. Intermaxillary
very long, styliform, tapering; maxillary well developed. Teeth
villiform. Eye large. Ventrals eight-rayed, inserted immediately
in front of or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_585">[585]</span> below the anterior dorsal rays. Dorsal fin
nearly in the middle of the length of the body; adipose fin
small; anal generally long; caudal forked. Branchiostegals from
eight to ten.</p>
</div>

<p>The fishes of this genus are small, of truly pelagic habits, and
distributed over all the temperate and tropical seas; they are so
numerous that the surface-net, when used during a night of moderate
weather, scarcely ever fails to enclose some specimens. They come to
the surface at night only; during the day and in very rough weather
they descend to depths where they are safe from sunlight or the
agitation of the water. Some species never rise to the surface; indeed,
Scopeli have been brought up in the dredge from almost any depth to
2500 fathoms. Thirty species are known. <i>Gymnoscopelus</i> differs
from <i>Scopelus</i> in lacking scales.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Ipnops.</span>—Body elongate, sub-cylindrical, covered with
large, thin, deciduous scales, and without phosphorescent
organs. Head depressed, with broad, long, spatulate snout, the
whole upper surface of which is occupied by a most peculiar
organ of vision (or luminosity), longitudinally divided in two
symmetrical halves. Bones of the head well ossified. Mouth wide,
with the lower jaw projecting; maxillary dilated behind. Both
jaws with narrow bands of villiform teeth; palate toothless.
Pectoral and ventral fins well developed, and, owing to the
shortness of the trunk, close together. Dorsal fin at a short
distance behind the vent; adipose fin none; anal fin moderately
long; caudal subtruncated. Pseudobranchiæ none.</p>
</div>

<p>This singular genus, one of the “Challenger” discoveries, is known
from four examples, obtained at depths varying between 1600 and 2150
fathoms, off the coast of Brazil, near Tristan d’Acunha and north of
Celebes. All belong to one species, <i>I. murrayi</i>. The eye seems to
have lost its function of vision and assumed that of producing light.
The specimens are from 4 to 5½ inches long.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Paralepis.</span>—Head and body elongate, compressed, covered
with deciduous scales. Cleft of the mouth very wide; maxillary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_586">[586]</span>

a single series, unequal in size. Eye large. Ventrals small,
inserted opposite or nearly opposite the dorsal. Dorsal fin
short, on the hinder part of the body; adipose fin small; anal
elongate, occupying the end of the tail; caudal emarginate.</p>

     <p class="p0 center smaller">Fig. 270.—Plagyodus ferox.</p>
  </div>

<p>This is one of the largest and most formidable deep-sea fishes.
One species only is well known, <i>P. ferox</i>, from Madeira and
the sea off Tasmania; other species have been noticed from Cuba
and the North Pacific, but it is not evident in what respects they
differ specifically from <i>P. ferox</i>. This fish grows to a
length of six feet, and from the stomach of one example have been
taken several Octopods, Crustaceans,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_587">[587]</span> Ascidians, a young Brama,
twelve young Boar-fishes, a Horse-mackerel, and one young of its own
species. The stomach is coecal; the commencement of the intestine has
extremely thick walls, its inner surface being cellular, like the
lung of a reptile; a pyloric appendage is absent. All the bones are
extremely thin, light, and flexible, containing very little earthy
matter; singular is the development of a system of abdominal ribs,
symmetrically arranged on both sides, and extending the whole length
of the abdomen. Perfect specimens are rarely obtained on account of
the want of coherence of the muscular and osseous parts, caused by the
diminution of pressure when the fish reaches the surface of the water.
The exact depth at which <i>Plagyodus</i> lives is not known; probably
it never rises above a depth of 300 fathoms.</p>

<p>The other less important genera belonging to this family are
<i>Aulopus</i>, <i>Chlorophthalmus</i>, <i>Scopelosaurus</i>,
<i>Odontostomus</i>, and <i>Nannobrachium</i>.</p>

Pyloric appendages none. Mouth toothless; lower pharyngeal bones
well developed, falciform, sub-parallel to the branchial arches,

Air-bladder large, divided into an anterior and posterior portion by a
constriction, or into a right or left portion, enclosed in an osseous
capsule. Ovarian sacs closed.</i></p>

<p>The family of “Carps” is the one most numerously represented in the
fresh waters of the Old World and of North America. Also numerous
fossil remains are found in tertiary freshwater-formations, as in the
limestones of Oeningen and Steinheim, in the lignites of Bonn, Stöchen,
Bilin, and Ménat, in the marl slates and carbonaceous shales of Licata
in Sicily, and of Padang in Sumatra, in corresponding deposits of Idaho
in North America. The majority can be referred to existing genera:
<i>Barbus</i>, <i>Thynnichthys</i>, <i>Gobio</i>, <i>Leuciscus</i>,
<i>Tinca</i>, <i>Amblypharyngodon</i>, <i>Rhodeus</i>, <i>Cobitis</i>,
<i>Acanthopsis</i>, only a few showing characters different from
those of living genera: <i>Cyclurus</i>, <i>Hexapsephus</i>,
<i>Mylocyprinus</i> (tertiary of North America).</p>

<p>Most Carps feed on vegetable and animal substances; a few only are
exclusive vegetable feeders. There is much less diversity of form and
habits in this family than in the Siluroids; however, the genera are
sufficiently numerous to demand a further subdivision of the family
into groups.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">Catostomina.</span>—<i>Pharyngeal teeth in a single series,
exceedingly numerous and closely set. Dorsal fin elongate, opposite to
the ventrals; anal short, or of moderate length. Barbels none.</i></p>

<p>These fishes are abundant in the lakes and rivers of North America,
more than thirty species having been described, and many more
named, by American ichthyologists. Two species are known from
North-Eastern Asia. They are generally called “Suckers,” but their
vernacular nomenclature is very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_589">[589]</span> arbitrary and confused. Some of
the species which inhabit the large rivers and lakes grow to a
length of three feet and a weight of fifteen pounds. The following
genera may be distinguished:—<i>Catostomus</i>, “Suckers,”
“Red-horses,” “Stone-rollers,” “White Mullets;” <i>Moxostoma</i>;
<i>Sclerognathus</i>, “Buffaloes,” “Black Horses;” and
<i>Carpiodes</i>, “Spear-fish,” “Sail-fish.”</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">Cyprinina.</span>—<i>Anal fin very short, with not more than
five or six, exceptionally seven, branched rays. Dorsal fin opposite
ventrals. Abdomen not compressed. Lateral line running along the median
line of the tail. Mouth frequently with barbels, never more than four
in number. Pharyngeal teeth generally in a triple series in the Old
World genera; in a double or single series in the North American forms,
which are small and feebly developed. Air-bladder present, without
osseous covering.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Cyprinus.</span>—Scales large. Dorsal fin long, with a more
or less strong serrated osseous ray; anal short. Snout rounded,
obtuse, mouth anterior, rather narrow. Pharyngeal teeth, 3. 1.
1.-1. 1. 3, molar-like. Barbels four.</p>

     <p class="p0 center smaller">Fig. 272.—The Carp, Cyprinus carpio.</p>
  </div>

<p>The “Carp” (<i>C. carpio</i>, “Karpfen,” “La carpe,”) is originally
a native of the East, and abounds in a wild state in China, where it
has been domesticated for many centuries; thence it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_590">[590]</span> was transported
to Germany and Sweden, and the year 1614 is assigned as the date of
its first introduction into England. It delights in tranquil waters,
preferring such as have a muddy bottom, and the surface partially
shaded with plants. Its food consists of the larvæ of aquatic insects,
minute testacea, worms, and the tender blades and shoots of plants. The
leaves of lettuce, and other succulent plants of a similar kind, are
said to be particularly agreeable to them, and to fatten them sooner
than any other food. Although the Carp eats with great voracity when
its supply of aliment is abundant, it can subsist for an astonishing
length of time without nourishment. In the winter, when the Carps
assemble in great numbers, and bury themselves among the mud and the
roots of plants, they often remain for many months without eating. They
can also be preserved alive for a considerable length of time out of
the water, especially if care be taken to moisten them occasionally
as they become dry. Advantage is often taken of this circumstance to
transport them alive, by packing them among damp herbage or damp linen;
and the operation is said to be unattended with any risk to the animal,
especially if the precaution be taken to put a piece of bread in its
mouth steeped in brandy!</p>

<p>The fecundity of these fishes is very great, and their numbers
consequently would soon become excessive but for the many enemies by
which their spawn is destroyed. No fewer than 700,000 eggs have been
found in the ovaries of a single Carp, and that, too, by no means an
individual of the largest size. Their growth is very rapid, more so
perhaps than that of any other Freshwater fish, and the size which they
sometimes attain is very considerable. In certain lakes in Germany
individuals are occasionally taken weighing thirty or forty pounds; and
Pallas relates that they occur in the Volga five feet in length, and
even of greater weight than the examples just alluded to. The largest
of which we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_591">[591]</span> have any account is that mentioned by Bloch, taken near
Frankfort-on-the-Oder, which weighed seventy pounds, and measured
nearly nine feet in length,—a statement the accuracy of which is very
much open to doubt.</p>

<p>Like other domesticated animals the Carp is subject to variation; some
individuals, especially when they have been bred under unfavourable
circumstances, have a lean and low body; others are shorter and higher.
Some have lost every trace of scales, and are called “Leather-carps;”
others retain them along the lateral line and on the back only
(“Spiegelkarpfen” of the Germans). Finally, in some are the fins much
prolonged, as in certain varieties of the Gold-fish. Cross-breeds
between the Carp and the Crucian Carp are of common occurrence.
The Carp is much more esteemed as food in inland countries than in
countries where the more delicate kinds of sea fishes can be obtained.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Carassius</span> differs from <i>Cyprinus</i> in lacking
barbels; its pharyngeal teeth are compressed, in a single
series, 4–4.</p>
</div>

<p>Two well-known species belong to this genus. The “Crucian Carp” (<i>C.
carassius</i>, “Karausche”) is generally distributed over Central
and Northern Europe, and extends into Italy and Siberia. It inhabits
stagnant waters only, and is so tenacious of life that it will survive
a lengthened sojourn in the smallest pools, where, however, it remains
stunted; whilst in favourable localities it attains to a length of
twelve inches. It is much subject to variation of form; very lean
examples are commonly called “Prussian Carps.” Its usefulness consists
in keeping ponds clean from a super-abundance of vegetable growth,
and in serving as food for other more esteemed fishes. The second
species is the “Gold-fish,” <i>Carassius auratus</i>. It is of very
common occurrence in a wild state in China and the warmer parts of
Japan, being entirely similar in colour to the Crucian Carp. In a
domesticated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_592">[592]</span> state it loses the black or brown chromatophors, and
becomes of a golden-yellow colour; perfect Albinos are comparatively
scarcer. Many varieties and monstrosities have been produced during
the long period of its domestication; the variety most highly priced
at present being the so-called “Telescope-fish,” of which a figure is
annexed. The Gold-fish is said to have been first brought to England
in the year 1691, and is now distributed over nearly all the civilised
parts of the world.</p>

<p>No other genus of Cyprinoids is composed of so many species as the
genus of “Barbels,” about 200 being known from the tropical and
temperate parts of the Old World; it is not represented in the New
World. Although the species differ much from each other in the form
of the body, number of barbels, size of the scales, strength of the
first dorsal ray or spine, etc., the transition between the extreme
forms is so perfect that no further generic subdivision should be
attempted. Some attain a length of six feet, whilst others never exceed
a length of two inches. The most noteworthy are the large Barbels of
the Tigris (<i>B. subquincunciatus</i>, <i>B. esocinus</i>, <i>B.
scheich</i>, <i>B. sharpeyi</i>); the common Barbel of Central Europe
and Great Britain (<i>B. vulgaris</i>); the “Bynni” of the Nile (<i>B.

mountain streams of India (<i>B. mosal</i>), probably the largest of
all species, the scales of which are sometimes as large as the palm of

</div>

<p>The numerous species of this genus are comprised under the name of
“White-fish;” they are equally abundant in the northern temperate
zone of both hemispheres, about forty species being known from the
Old World, and about fifty from the New. The most noteworthy species
of the former Fauna are the “Roach” (<i>L. rutilus</i>, see Fig. <a href="#fig21">21</a>,
p. 50), common all over Europe north of the Alps; the “Chub” (<i>L.
cephalus</i>), extending into Northern Italy and Asia Minor; the
“Dace” (<i>L. leuciscus</i>), a companion of the Roach; the “Id” or
“Nerfling” (<i>L. idus</i>), from the central and northern parts
of Continental Europe, domesticated in some localities of Germany,
in this condition assuming the golden hue of semi-albinism, like
a Gold-fish, and then called the “Orfe;” the “Rudd,” or “Red-eye”
(<i>L. erythrophthalmus</i>), distributed all over Europe and Asia
Minor, and distinguished by its scarlet lower fins; the “Minnow”
(<i>L. phoxinus</i>), abundant everywhere in Europe, and growing
to a length of seven inches in favourable localities. The North
American species are much less perfectly known; the smaller ones are
termed “Minnows,” the larger “Shiner” or “Dace.” The most common are
<i>L. cornutus</i> (Red-fin, Red Dace); <i>L. neogæus</i>, a minnow
resembling the European species, but with incomplete lateral line;
<i>L. hudsonius</i>, the “Spawn-eater” or “Smelt.”</p>

<p>Only one species of “Tench” is known (<i>T. tinca</i>), found all over
Europe in stagnant waters with soft bottom. The “Golden Tench” is only
a variety of colour, an incipient albinism like the Gold-fish and Id.
Like most other Carps of this group it passes the winter in a state of
torpidity, during which it ceases to feed. It is extremely prolific,
297,000 ova having been counted in one female; its spawn is of a
greenish colour.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Abramis.</span>—Body much compressed, elevated, or oblong.
Scales of moderate size. Lateral line present, running in the
lower half of the tail. Dorsal fin short, with spine, opposite
to the space between ventrals and anals. Lower jaw generally
shorter, and rarely longer than the upper. Both jaws with simple
lips, the lower labial fold being interrupted at the symphysis
of the mandible. Upper jaw protractile. Gill-rakers rather
short; pseudobranchiæ. The attachment of the branchial membrane
to the isthmus takes place at some distance behind the vertical

</div>

<p>The “Breams” are represented in the temperate parts of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_603">[603]</span> both northern
hemispheres; in Europe there occur the “Common Bream,” <i>A. brama</i>;
the “Zope,” <i>A. ballerus</i>; <i>A. sapa</i>; the “Zärthe,” <i>A.
vimba</i>; <i>A. elongatus</i>; the “White Bream,” <i>A. blicca</i>;
<i>A. bipunctatus</i>. Of these <i>A. brama</i> and <i>A. blicca</i>
are British; the former being one of the most common fishes, and
sometimes attaining to a length of two feet. Crosses between these two
species, and even with other Cyprinoids, are not rare. Of the American
species <i>A. americanus</i> (“Shiner,” “Bream”) is common and widely
distributed; like the European Bream it lives chiefly in stagnant
waters or streams with a slow current.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_604">[604]</span></p>

<p>“Bleak” are numerous in Europe and Western Asia, fifteen species being
known. The common Bleak (<i>A. alburnus</i>) is found north of the
Alps only, and represented by another species (<i>A. alburnellus</i>,
“Alborella,” or “Avola”) in Italy.</p>

<p>Of the other genera referred to this group, <i>Leucaspius</i> and
<i>Pelecus</i> belong to the European Fauna; <i>Pelotrophus</i> is
East African; all the others occur in the East Indies or the temperate
parts of Asia, viz. <i>Rasborichthys</i>, <i>Elopichthys</i>,
<i>Acanthobrama</i> (Western Asia), <i>Osteobrama</i>,
<i>Chanodichthys</i>, <i>Hemiculter</i>, <i>Smiliogaster</i>,
<i>Toxabramis</i>, <i>Culter</i>, <i>Eustira</i>, <i>Chela</i>,
<i>Pseudolabuca</i>, and <i>Cachius</i>.</p>

<p>XIII. <span class="smcap">Homalopterina.</span>—<i>Dorsal and anal fins short, the
former opposite to ventrals. Pectoral and ventral fins horizontal, the
former with the outer rays simple. Barbels six or none. Air-bladder
absent. Pharyngeal teeth in a single series, from ten to sixteen in

<p>Inhabitants of hill-streams in the East Indies; they are of small size
and abundant where they occur. Thirteen species are known belonging to
the genera <i>Homaloptera</i>, <i>Gastromyzon</i>, <i>Crossostoma</i>,
and <i>Psilorhynchus</i>.</p>

<p>XIV. <span class="smcap">Cobitidina.</span>—<i>Mouth surrounded by six or more barbels.

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Misgurnus.</span>—Body elongate, compressed. No sub-orbital
spine. Ten or twelve barbels, four belonging to the mandible.
Dorsal fin opposite to the ventrals; caudal rounded.</p>
</div>

<p>Four species from Europe and Asia. <i>M. fossilis</i> is the largest
of European Loaches, growing to a length of ten inches; it occurs in
stagnant waters of eastern and southern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_605">[605]</span> Germany and northern Asia.
In China and Japan it is replaced by an equally large species, <i>M.
anguillicaudatus</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Nemachilus.</span>—No erectile sub-orbital spine. Six
barbels, none at the mandible. Dorsal fin opposite to the
ventrals.</p>
</div>

<p>The greater number of Loaches belong to this genus; about fifty species
are known from Europe and temperate Asia; such species as extend
into tropical parts inhabit streams of high altitudes. Loaches are
partial to fast-running streams with stony bottom, and exclusively
animal feeders. In spite of their small size they are esteemed as food
where they occur in sufficient abundance. The British species, <i>N.
barbatulus</i>, is found all over Europe except Denmark and Scandinavia.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Cobitis.</span>—Body more or less compressed, elongate; back
not arched. A small, erectile, bifid sub-orbital spine below
the eye. Six barbels only on the upper jaw. Dorsal fin inserted
opposite to ventrals. Caudal rounded or truncate.</p>
</div>

<p>Only three species are known, of which <i>C. tænia</i> occurs in
Europe. It is scarce and very local in Great Britain.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Botia.</span>—Body compressed, oblong; back more or less
arched. Eyes with a free circular eyelid; an erectile bifid
sub-orbital spine. Six barbels on the upper jaw, sometimes two
others at the mandibulary symphysis. Dorsal fin commencing
in advance of the root of the ventrals; caudal fin forked.
Air-bladder consisting of two divisions: the anterior enclosed
in a partly osseous capsule, the posterior free, floating in the
abdominal cavity.</p>
</div>

  </div>

<p>This genus is more tropical than any of the preceding, and the majority
of the species (eight in number) are finely coloured. The more elevated
form of their body, and the imperfect ossification of the capsules of
the air-bladder, the divisions of which are not side<span class="pagenum" id="Page_606">[606]</span> by side, but
placed in the longitudinal axis of the body, indicate likewise that
this genus is more adapted for still waters of the plains than for the
currents of hill-streams.</p>

<p>Other genera from tropical India are <i>Lepidocephalichthys</i>,
<i>Acanthopsis</i>, <i>Oreonectes</i> (hills near Hong-Kong),
<i>Paramisgurnus</i> (Yan-tse-Kiang), <i>Lepidocephalus</i>,
<i>Acanthophthalmus</i>, and <i>Apua</i>.</p>


<h6 class="smcap">Fourth Family—Kneriidæ.</h6>

<p><i>Body scaly, head naked. Margin of the upper jaw formed by the
intermaxillaries. Dorsal and anal fins short, the former belonging
to the abdominal portion of the vertebral column. Teeth none, either
in the mouth or pharynx. Barbels none. Stomach siphonal; no pyloric
appendages. Pseudobranchiæ none. Branchiostegals three; air-bladder
long, not divided. Ovaries closed.</i></p>

<p>Small loach-like fishes from fresh waters of tropical Africa; two
species only, <i>Kneria angolensis</i> and <i>K. spekii</i>, are known.</p>


<h6 class="smcap">Fifth Family—Characinidæ.</h6>

<p><i>Body covered with scales, head naked; barbels none. Margin of the
upper jaw formed by the intermaxillaries in the middle and by the
maxillaries laterally. Generally a small adipose fin behind the dorsal.
Pyloric appendages more or less numerous; air-bladder transversely
divided into two portions, and communicating with the organ of hearing
by means of the auditory ossicles. Pseudobranchiæ none.</i></p>

<p>The fishes of this family are confined to the fresh waters of Africa,
and especially of tropical America, where they replace the Cyprinoids,
with which family, however, they have but little in common as far as
their structural characteristics are concerned. Their co-existence
in Africa with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_607">[607]</span> Cyprinoids proves only that that continent is nearer
to the original centre, from which the distribution of Cyprinoids
commenced than tropical America. The family includes herbivorous as
well as strictly carnivorous forms; some are toothless, whilst others
possess a most formidable dentition. The family contains so many
diversified forms as to render a subdivision into groups necessary.
They have not yet been obtained in fossiliferous strata.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">Erythrinina.</span>—<i>Adipose fin absent.</i></p>

<p>The sixteen species of this group belong to the fauna of tropical
America, and are referred to the genera <i>Macrodon</i>,
<i>Erythrinus</i>, <i>Lebiasina</i>, <i>Nannostomus</i>,
<i>Pyrrhulina</i>, and <i>Corynopoma</i>.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">Curimatina.</span>—<i>A short dorsal and an adipose fin;
dentition imperfect. Tropical America.</i></p>

rudimentary or absent in some part of the jaws: <i>Prochilodus</i>,
<i>Cænotropus</i>, <i>Hemiodus</i>, <i>Saccodon</i>, <i>Parodon</i>.</p>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">Citharinina.</span>—<i>A rather long dorsal and an adipose fin;

<p>This genus is generally distributed in the rivers east of the
Andes; about twenty species are known, some of which, like <i>L.
frederici</i>, <i>L. megalepis</i>, are very common. They are well
marked by black bands or spots, and rarely grow to a length of two
feet, being generally much smaller.—The other genera belonging to this
group are <i>Anastomus</i> and <i>Rhytiodus</i>.</p>

<p>V. <span class="smcap">Nannocharacina.</span>—<i>A short dorsal and an adipose fin;
teeth in both jaws well developed; notched incisors. The gill-membranes
are grown to the isthmus. Nostrils close together.</i></p>

<p>One genus, <i>Nannocharax</i>, with two species only, from the Nile and
Gaboon; very small.</p>

<p>VI. <span class="smcap">Tetragonopterina.</span>—<i>A short dorsal and an adipose

</div>

<p>Fourteen species from Tropical Africa; several inhabit the Nile, of
which the “Raches” (<i>A. dentex</i> and <i>A. kotschyi</i>) are the
most common.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Tetragonopterus.</span>—The dorsal fin is placed in the

Intermaxillary and mandibulary teeth subequal in size, with
a compressed and notched crown, the former in a double, the
latter in a single series; maxillary with a few teeth near its
articulation, rarely with the entire edge denticulated.</p>
</div>

<p>Of all the genera of this family <i>Tetragonopterus</i> is represented
by the greatest number of species; about fifty are known. Some of them
seem to have a very wide range, whilst others are merely local. All are
of small size, rarely exceeding a length of eight inches.</p>

<i>teeth in both jaws well developed and conical; gill membranes free
from the isthmus; nasal openings close together. South America and
Tropical Africa. Fishes of prey.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Hydrocyon.</span>—The dorsal fin is in the middle of the
length of the body, above the ventrals; anal of moderate length.
Body oblong, compressed, covered with scales of moderate size;
belly rounded. Cleft of the mouth wide, without lips; the
intermaxillaries and mandibles are armed with strong pointed
teeth, widely set and few in number; they are received in
notches of the opposite jaw, and visible externally when the
mouth is closed. Palate toothless. Cheeks covered with the
enlarged sub-orbital bones. Orbit with an anterior and posterior
adipose eyelid. Intestinal tract short.</p>
</div>

<p>Four species from Tropical Africa; two occur in the Nile, <i>H.
forskalii</i> being abundant, and well known by the names “Kelb el
bahr” and “Kelb el moyeh.” Their formidable dentition renders them most
destructive to other fishes; they grow to a length of four feet.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Cynodon.</span>—Dorsal fin placed behind, or nearly in, the
middle of the length of the body, behind the ventrals; anal
long. Head and body compressed, oblong, the latter covered
with very small scales; belly compressed, keeled. Teeth in the
intermaxillary, maxillary, and mandible in a single series,
conical, widely set, of unequal size; a pair of very large
canine teeth anteriorly in the lower jaw, received in two
grooves on the palate; palate with patches of minute granulated
teeth. The outer branchial arch without gill-rakers, but with
very short tubercles.</p>
</div>

<p>Four species from Brazil and the Guyanas; they are as formidable fishes
of prey as the preceding, and grow to the same size.</p>

<p>With the exception of <i>Sarcodaces</i>, all the remaining
genera of this group belong to the fauna of Tropical America,
viz. <i>Anacyrtus</i>, <i>Hystricodon</i>, <i>Salminus</i>,
<i>Oligosarcus</i>, <i>Xiphorhamphus</i>, and <i>Xiphostoma</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_612">[612]</span></p>

<p>VIII. <span class="smcap">Distichodontina.</span>—<i>Dorsal fin rather elongate; adipose
fin present. Gill-membranes attached to the isthmus; belly rounded.
Tropical Africa.</i></p>

<p>The species, ten in number, belong to one genus only
(<i>Distichodus</i>), well known on the Nile under the name of
“Nefasch.” They grow to a considerable size, being sometimes four feet
long and one and a half foot deep. They are used as food.</p>

<p>IX. <span class="smcap">Ichthyborina.</span>—<i>An adipose fin; number of dorsal rays
increased (12–17); gill-membranes free from the isthmus. Belly rounded;
canine teeth. Tropical Africa.</i></p>

<p>Two genera only: <i>Ichthyborus</i> from the Nile, and <i>Phago</i>
from West Africa. Small fishes of very rare occurrence.</p>

<p>X. <span class="smcap">Crenuchina.</span>—<i>Dorsal fin rather elongate; an adipose
fin. Gill-membranes free from the isthmus, with the belly rounded, and
without canine teeth.</i></p>

<p>This small group is represented in the Essequibo by a single species,
<i>Crenuchus spilurus</i>, and by another in West Africa, <i>Xenocharax
spilurus</i>.</p>

<p>XI. <span class="smcap">Serrasalmonina.</span>—<i>Dorsal fin rather elongate; an adipose
fin. Gill-membranes free from the isthmus; belly serrated. Tropical
America.</i></p>

<p>Although the fishes of this family do not attain any considerable size,
the largest scarcely exceeding two feet in length, their voracity,
fearlessness, and number renders them a perfect pest in many rivers
of tropical America. In all, the teeth are strong, short, sharp,
sometimes lobed incisors, arranged in one or more series; by means
of them they cut off a mouthful of flesh as with a pair of scissors;
and any animal falling into the water where these fishes abound is
immediately attacked and cut in pieces in an incredibly short time.
They assail persons entering the water, inflicting dangerous wounds
before the victims are able to make their escape.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_613">[613]</span> In some localities
it is scarcely possible to catch fishes with the hook and line, as the
fish hooked is immediately attacked by the “Caribe” (as these fishes
are called), and torn to pieces before it can be withdrawn from the
water. The Caribes themselves are rarely hooked, as they snap the
hook or cut the line. The smell of blood is said to attract at once
thousands of these fishes to a spot. They are most abundant in the
Brazils and Guyanas; some forty species are known, and referred to
the genera <i>Mylesinus</i>, <i>Serrasalmo</i>, <i>Myletes</i>, and
<i>Catoprion</i>.</p>

<h6 class="smcap">Sixth Family—Cyprinodontidæ.</h6>

<p><i>Head and body covered with scales; barbels none. Margin of the upper
jaw formed by the intermaxillaries only. Teeth in both jaws; upper
and lower pharyngeals with cardiform teeth. Adipose fin none; dorsal
fin situated on the hinder half of the body. Stomach without blind
sac; pyloric appendages none. Pseudobranchiæ none; air-bladder simple,
without ossicula auditus.</i></p>

<p>Small fishes, inhabiting fresh, brackish, and salt water of Southern
Europe, Africa, Asia, and America. The majority<span class="pagenum" id="Page_614">[614]</span> are viviparous; and to
facilitate copulation the anal fin of the adult male of many species
is modified into a copulatory organ, which is probably (partially at
least) introduced into the vulva of the female; but it is uncertain
whether it serves to conduct the semen, or merely to give the male
a firmer hold of the female during the act. Also secondary sexual
differences are developed in the Cyprinodonts; the males are always
the smaller, sometimes several times smaller than the females, quite
diminutive; and they are perhaps the smallest fishes in existence. The
fins generally are more developed in the males, and the coloration is
frequently different also. Some species are carnivorous; others live
on the organic substances mixed with mud. Fossil remains have been
found in tertiary strata, all apparently referable to the existing
genus <i>Cyprinodon</i>; they occur near Aix in Provence, in the marl
of Gesso, St. Angelo, in the Brown coal near Bonn, near Frankfort,
and in the freshwater-chalk of Oeningen. In the latter locality a
<i>Poecilia</i> occurs likewise.</p>

<p>The genera can be divided into two groups:</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">Cyprinodontidæ Carnivoræ.</span>—<i>The bones of each ramus of
the mandible are firmly united; intestinal tract short, or but little
convoluted. Carnivorous or insectivorous.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Cyprinodon.</span>—Cleft of the mouth small, developed
laterally and horizontally. Snout short. Teeth of moderate size,
incisor-like, notched, in a single series. Scales rather large.
Origin of the anal fin behind that of the dorsal in both sexes,
both fins being larger in the male than in the female. Anal not
modified into a sexual organ.</p>
</div>

<p>Seven species occur in the Mediterranean region, all of which seem
able to live in briny springs or pools, the water of which contains a
much greater percentage of salts than sea-water, as the brine-springs
near the Dead Sea or in the Sahara. They are as little affected by
the high temperature of some of these springs (91°), for instance
of that at Sidi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_615">[615]</span> Ohkbar in the Sahara. Like other fishes living in
limited localities or concealing themselves in mud, Cyprinodonts lose
sometimes their ventral fins; such specimens have been described as
<i>Tellia</i>. The species of the New World are less known than those
of the Old, but not less numerous.</p>

<p>Allied to Cyprinodon are <i>Fitzroyia</i> from Monte Video, and
<i>Characodon</i> from Central America.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Haplochilus.</span>—Snout flat, both jaws being much
depressed, and armed with a narrow band of villiform teeth. Body
oblong, depressed anteriorly, compressed posteriorly. Dorsal fin
short, commencing behind the origin of the anal, which is more
or less elongate.</p>
</div>

<p>Twenty species from the East Indies, tropical Africa, and temperate and
tropical America.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Fundulus.</span>—Cleft of the mouth of moderate width,
developed laterally and horizontally. Snout of moderate length.
Teeth in a narrow band, those of the outer series being largest,
conical. Scales of moderate size. Dorsal fin commencing before
or opposite the origin of the anal. Sexes not differentiated.</p>
</div>

<p>“Killifish,” abundant in the New World, where about twenty species have
been found; <i>F. heteroclitus</i>, <i>majalis</i>, <i>diaphanus</i>,
being common on the Atlantic coast of the United States; from the
Old World two species only are known, viz. <i>F. hispanicus</i>
from Spain, and <i>F. orthonotus</i> from the east coast of Africa.
Allied to <i>Fundulus</i> are the South American <i>Limnurgus</i>,
<i>Lucania</i>, <i>Rivulus</i>, and <i>Cynolebias</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Orestias.</span>—Ventral fins none. Cleft of the mouth
of moderate width, directed upwards, with the lower jaw
prominent, and with the upper protractile. Both jaws with a
narrow band Of small conical teeth. Scales rather small or
of moderate size, those on the head and upper part of the
trunk frequently enlarged, plate-like, and granulated. Dorsal
and anal fins moderately developed, opposite to each other.
Sexes not differentiated by modification of the anal fin. The
gill-membranes of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_616">[616]</span> both sides are united for a short distance,
and not attached to the isthmus.</p>
</div>

<p>Inhabitants of Lake Titicaca and other elevated sheets of water on the
Cordilleras of Peru and Bolivia, between the 14th and 19th degrees of
latitude, at an elevation of 13,000 and 14,000 feet above the level
of the sea. Singularly, the fishes of this outlying genus attain to a
greater size than any other members of this family, being about eight
inches long and comparatively bulky. They are considered a delicacy.
Six species.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Jenynsia.</span>—Cleft of the mouth small, developed
laterally and horizontally; snout not produced. Both jaws with a
series of tricuspid teeth of moderate size. Scales of moderate
size. The origin of the anal fin is, in both sexes, behind that
of the dorsal, although the anal of the male is modified into
an intromittent organ, in which scarcely any of the rays remain
distinct.</p>
</div>

<p>One species from Maldonado.</p>

  </div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Gambusia.</span>—Cleft of the mouth developed laterally and
horizontally. Snout not produced, with the lower jaw more or
less prominent. Both jaws with a band of teeth, those of the
outer series being strongest and conical. Scales rather large.
Origin of the anal fin more or less in advance of that of the
dorsal. Anal fin of the male modified into an intromittent organ
and much advanced.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_617">[617]</span></p>

<p>Eight species from the West Indies and the southern parts
of South America.—Allied genera are the Central American
<i>Pseudoxiphophorus</i> and <i>Belonesox</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Anableps.</span>—Head broad and depressed, with the
supraorbital part very much raised. Body elongate, depressed
anteriorly and compressed posteriorly. Cleft of the mouth
horizontal, of moderate width, the mandible being short; upper
jaw protractile. Both jaws armed with a band of villiform teeth,
those of the outer series being largest and somewhat movable.
The integuments of the eye are divided into an upper and lower
portion by a dark-coloured transverse band of the conjunctiva;
also the pupil is completely divided into two by a pair of lobes
projecting from each side of the iris. Scales rather small or of
moderate size. Dorsal and anal fins short, the former behind the
latter. The anal fin of the male is modified into a thick and
long scaly conical organ with an orifice at its extremity.</p>
</div>

<p>Three species from tropical America. They are the longest Cyprinodonts,
attaining to the length of nearly twelve inches. Their peculiar habit
of swimming with part of the head out of the water has been noticed
above (p. 113).</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">Cyprinodontidæ Limnophagæ.</span>—<i>The bones of each ramus of
the mandible are but loosely joined; intestinal tract with numerous
circumvolutions. Sexes differentiated. Mud-eating. Tropical America.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Poecilia.</span>—Cleft of the mouth small, transverse;
mandible very short. Both jaws with a narrow band of minute
teeth. Scales rather large. Origin of the anal fin generally
nearly opposite to that of the dorsal fin in the female, but
in the male it is modified into an intromittent organ and much
advanced. Dorsal fin short, with not more than eleven rays.</p>
</div>

<p>Sixteen species.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Mollienesia.</span>—Differing from <i>Poecilia</i> in having
a larger dorsal fin, with twelve or more rays.</p>
</div>

<p>Five species. The males are most beautifully coloured, and their dorsal
fin is much enlarged. In one species (<i>M.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_618">[618]</span> hellerii</i>), besides,
the lower caudal rays of the mature male are prolonged into a long,
sword-shaped, generally black and yellow appendage.</p>

<p>Two other genera belong to this group: <i>Platypoecilus</i> and
<i>Girardinus</i>.</p>


<h6 class="smcap">Seventh Family—Heteropygii.</h6>

<p><i>Head naked; body covered with very small scales; barbels none.
Margin of the upper jaw formed, by the intermaxillaries. Villiform
teeth in the jaws and on the palate. Adipose fin none. Dorsal fin
belonging to the caudal portion of the vertebral column, opposite to
the anal. Ventral fins rudimentary or absent. Vent situated before the
pectorals. Stomach coecal; pyloric appendages present. Pseudobranchiæ
none; air-bladder deeply notched anteriorly.</i></p>

<p>To this small family, which is closely allied to the Cyprinodonts and
Umbridæ, belongs the famous Blind Fish of the Mammoth Cave in Kentucky,
<i>Amblyopsis spelæus</i>. It is destitute of external eyes, and the
body is colourless; although the eyes, with the optic nerve, are quite
rudimentary, the optic lobes are as much developed as in fishes with
perfect eyes. The loss of vision is compensated by the acuteness of
its sense of hearing, as well as by a great number of tactile papillæ,
arranged on transverse ridges on the head, and provided with nervous
filaments coming from the fifth pair. The ovary is single, and the
fish is viviparous, like the Cyprinodonts. It seems to occur in all
the subterranean rivers that flow through the great limestone region
underlying the carboniferous rocks in the central portion of the United
States. As in <i>Cyprinodon</i>, so in this genus, specimens occur
without ventral fins; they have been called <i>Typhlichthys</i>. The
largest size to which <i>Amblyopsis</i> grows is five inches.</p>

<p><i>Chologaster</i> is closely allied, but provided with small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_619">[619]</span> external
eyes; its body is coloured, but it is destitute of ventrals. It was
found once in a rice field in South Carolina.</p>

</div>


<h6 class="smcap">Eighth Family—Umbridæ.</h6>

<p><i>Head and body covered with scales; barbels none. Margin of the upper
jaw formed by the intermaxillaries mesially, and by the maxillaries
laterally. Adipose fin none; the dorsal fin belongs partly to the
abdominal portion of the vertebral column. Stomach siphonal; pyloric
appendages none; pseudobranchiæ glandular, hidden; air-bladder
simple.</i></p>

<p>Two small species only are known: <i>Umbra krameri</i> from Austria
and Hungary, and <i>Umbra limi</i>, locally distributed in the United
States; called “Hunds-fish” in Germany, “Dog-fish” or “Mud-fish” in
America.</p>


<h6 class="smcap">Ninth Family—Scombresocidæ.</h6>

<p><i>Body covered with scales; a series of keeled scales along each side
of the belly. Margin of the upper jaw formed by the intermaxillaries
mesially, and by the maxillaries laterally. Lower pharyngeals united
into a single bone. Dorsal fin opposite the anal, belonging to the
caudal portion of the vertebral column. Adipose fin none. Air-bladder
generally present, simple, sometimes cellular, without pneumatic
duct. Pseudobranchiæ hidden, glandular. Stomach not distinct from the
intestine, which is quite straight, without appendages.</i></p>

<p>The fishes of this family are chiefly marine, some living in the open
ocean, whilst others have become acclimatised in fresh water; many of
the latter are viviparous, all the marine forms being oviparous. They
are found in all the temperate and tropical zones. Carnivorous.</p>

<p>This family is represented in the strata of Monte Bolca by rare
remains of a fish named <i>Holosteus</i>, allied to <i>Belone</i> or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_620">[620]</span>
<i>Scombresox</i>, and by a species of <i>Belone</i> in the miocene of
Licata.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Belone.</span>—Both jaws are prolonged into a long slender
beak. All the dorsal and anal rays connected by membrane.</p>
</div>

<p>The long upper jaw of the “Gar-pike” is formed by the intermaxillaries,
which are united by a longitudinal suture. Both jaws are beset with
asperities, and with a series of longer, conical-pointed, widely-set
teeth. Skimming along the surface of the water, the Gar-pike seize
with these long jaws small fish as a bird would seize them with its
beak; but their gullet is narrow, so that they can swallow small fish
only. They swim with an undulating motion of the body; although they
are in constant activity, their progress through the water is much
slower than that of the Mackerels, the shoals of which sometimes
appear simultaneously with them on our coasts. Young specimens are
frequently met in the open ocean; when very young their jaws are not
prolonged, and during growth the lower jaw is much in advance of the
upper, so that these young fishes resemble a <i>Hemirhamphus</i>. About
fifty species are known from tropical and temperate seas, <i>Belone
belone</i> being a common fish on the British coast. Its bones, like
those of all its congeners, are green; and therefore the fish, although
good eating, is disliked by many persons. Some species attain a length
of five feet.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Scombresox.</span>—Both jaws are prolonged into a long
slender beak. A number of detached finlets behind the dorsal and
anal fins.</p>
</div>

<p>The “Saury” or “Skipper” resemble the Gar-pike, but the teeth in the
jaws are minute; they seem to feed chiefly on soft pelagic animals. In
their habits they are still more pelagic; and the young, in which the
beak is still undeveloped, are met with everywhere in the open ocean,
in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_621">[621]</span> Atlantic as well as in the Pacific. The European species,
<i>Sc. saurus</i>, is not rare on the British coast; four other species
have been described, closely allied to <i>Sc. saurus</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Hemirhamphus.</span>—The lower jaw only is prolonged into a
long slender beak.</p>
</div>

<p>In the young both jaws are short; the upper is never prolonged, the
intermaxillaries forming a triangular, more or less convex, plate.
The “Half-beaks” are common between and near the tropics; some forty
species are known, none of which attain to the same length as the
Gar-pike, scarcely ever exceeding a length of two feet. Some of the
tropical species live in fresh water only; they are of small size and
viviparous.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Arrhamphus.</span>—Mouth formed as in <i>Hemirhamphus</i>,
except that the lower jaw is not produced into a beak. Pectoral
fins of moderate length.</p>
</div>

<p>One species (<i>A. sclerolepis</i>) from the coast of Queensland
(not New Zealand); it may be regarded as a <i>Hemirhamphus</i>, with
retarded development of the lower jaw.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Exocoetus.</span>—Jaws short, intermaxillaries and
maxillaries separate. Teeth minute, rudimental, and sometimes
absent. Body moderately oblong, covered with rather large
scales. Pectorals very long, an organ of flying.</p>

     <p class="p0 center smaller">Fig. 281.—Flying Fish; Exocoetus callopterus.</p>
  </div>

<p>Forty-four different kinds of “Flying-fishes” are known from tropical
and sub-tropical seas; some have a very wide range, whilst others seem
to remain within one particular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_622">[622]</span> part of the ocean; thus, the species
figured, <i>E. callopterus</i>, has been hitherto found on the Pacific
side of the isthmus of Panama only. Their usual length is about 10 or
12 inches, but specimens of 18 inches have been caught. They always
live in shoals, and their numbers at certain times and localities are
immense; thus, at Barbadoes many boats engage in their capture, as
they are excellent eating. The pectorals are in the various species of
unequal length; in some they extend to the anal fin only; in others
(and these are the best fliers) to the caudal. A few have curious,
barbel-like appendages at the lower jaw, which may disappear with age
or be persistent throughout life. The literature on the subject of
Flying-fishes is very extensive, and great diversity of opinion exists
among observers as regards the mode and power of their flight; but
the most reliable agree that the fishes do not leave the water for
the purpose of catching insects (!), and that they are unable to move
their fins in the manner of a bat or bird, or to change voluntarily the
direction of their flight, or to fly beyond a very limited distance.
The most recent enquiries are those of K. Möbius (“Die Bewegungen
der Fliegenden Fische durch die Luft,” Leip. 1878, 8vo), the chief
results of which may be summed up thus: Flying-fish are more frequently
observed in rough weather and in a disturbed sea than during calm; they
dart out of the water when pursued by their enemies, or frightened
by an approaching vessel, but frequently also without any apparent
cause, as is also observed in many other fishes; and they rise without
regard to the direction of the wind or waves. The fins are kept quietly
distended, without any motion, except an occasional vibration caused
by the air whenever the surface of the wing is parallel with the
current of the wind. Their flight is rapid, but gradually decreasing
in velocity, greatly exceeding that of a ship going 10 miles an hour,
and a distance of 500 feet. Generally, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_623">[623]</span> is longer when the fishes
fly against than with or at an angle to the wind. Any vertical or
horizontal deviation from a straight line is not caused at the will of
the fish, but by currents of the air; thus they retain a horizontally
straight course when flying with or against the wind, but are carried
towards the right or left whenever the direction of the wind is at an
angle with that of their flight. However, it sometimes happens that
the fish during its flight immerses its caudal fin in the water, and
by a stroke of its tail turns towards the right or left. In a calm the
line of their flight is always also vertically straight, or rather
parabolic, like the course of a projectile, but it may become undulated
in a rough sea, when they are flying against the course of the waves;
they then frequently overtop each wave, being carried over it by the
pressure of the disturbed air. Flying-fishes often fall on board of
vessels, but this never happens during a calm, or from the lee side,
but during a breeze only, and from the weather side. In daytime they
avoid a ship, flying away from it; but during the night, when they
are unable to see, they frequently fly against the weather-board,
where they are caught by the current of air, and carried upwards to a
height of 20 feet above the surface of the water, while, under ordinary
circumstances, they keep close to it. All these observations point
clearly to the fact that any deflection from a straight course is due
to external circumstances, and not to voluntary action on the part of
the fish.</p>


<h6 class="smcap">Tenth Family—Esocidæ.</h6>

<p><i>Body covered with scales; barbels none. Margin of the upper jaw
formed by the intermaxillaries mesially, and by the maxillaries
laterally. Adipose fin none; the dorsal fin belongs to the caudal
portion of the vertebral column. Stomach without blind sac; pyloric
appendages none. Pseudobranchiæ glandular, hidden; air-bladder simple;
gill-opening very wide.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_624">[624]</span></p>

<p>This family includes one genus only, <i>Esox</i>, the “Pikes,”
inhabitants of the fresh waters of the temperate parts of Europe, Asia,
and America. The European species, <i>E. lucius</i>, inhabits all three
continents, but the North American waters harbour five, or perhaps
more, other species, of which the “Muskellunge,” or “Maskinonge” (<i>E.
estor</i>) of the Great Lakes attains to the same large size as the
common Pike. The other species are generally called “Pickerell” in the
United States.</p>

Remains of the common Pike occur in abundance in quaternary deposits.</p>


<h6 class="smcap">Eleventh Family—Galaxiidæ.</h6>

<p><i>Body naked, barbels none. Margin of the upper jaw chiefly formed
by the intermaxillaries, which are short, and continued by a thick
lip, behind which are the maxillaries. Belly rounded; adipose fin
none; dorsal opposite to anal. Pyloric appendages in small number.
Air-bladder large, simple; pseudobranchiæ none. The ova fall into the
cavity of the abdomen before exclusion.</i></p>

<p>Small freshwater fishes of the southern hemisphere, belonging to
two genera, <i>Galaxias</i> and <i>Neochanna</i>. Of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_625">[625]</span> former
genus five species are found in New Zealand, where this type is most
developed, three in New South Wales, two in Tasmania, and four in the
southern extremity of South America. Their native name in New Zealand
is “Kokopu,” and they were dignified with the name of “Trout” by the
settlers before the introduction of true Salmonidæ. They rarely exceed
a length of eight inches. <i>Neochanna</i> is a degraded form of
<i>Galaxias</i>, from which it differs by the absence of ventral fins.
This fish has hitherto been found only in burrows, which it excavates
in clay or consolidated mud, at a distance from water.</p>

coalesce into a single bone, and laterally by the maxillaries. Sub-
and inter-operculum present, the latter very small. On each side of

<p>This family is characteristic of the freshwater fauna of tropical
Africa. Of <i>Mormyrus</i> (including <i>Hyperopisus</i> and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_626">[626]</span>
<i>Mormyrops</i>), fifty-one species are known, of which eleven occur
in the Nile. Some attain a length of three or four feet, others remain
small. Their flesh is said to have an excellent flavour. The species
figured (and probably other allied species) was an object of veneration
to the ancient Egyptians, and, therefore, frequently occurs in their
emblematic inscriptions. They abstained from eating it because it was
one of three different kinds of fishes accused of having devoured a
member of the body of Osiris, which, therefore, Isis was unable to
recover when she collected the rest of the scattered members of her
husband.</p>

<p>The <i>Mormyri</i> possess a singular organ on each side of the tail,
without electric functions, but evidently representing a transitional
condition from muscular substance to an electric organ. It is an oblong
capsule divided into numerous compartments by vertical transverse
septa, and containing a gelatinous substance. The <i>Mormyri</i> differ
much with regard to the extent of the dorsal and anal fins, the former
sometimes occupying the greater portion of the length of the back,
sometimes being much shorter and limited to the tail. In some the snout
is short and obtuse, in others long and decurved, with or without
appendage.</p>

<p>Of <i>Gymnarchus</i> one species only is known, <i>G. niloticus</i>,
which occurs in the Nile and West African rivers, and attains a
length of six feet. The form of its body is eel-like, and each jaw
is armed with a series of incisor-like teeth.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_627">[627]</span> Like <i>Mormyrus</i>,
<i>Gymnarchus</i> possesses a pseudo-electric organ, thickest on the
tail, tapering in front, and extending nearly to the head. It consists
of four membranaceous tubes intimately connected with the surrounding
muscles, and containing prismatic bodies arranged in the manner
of a paternoster. The air-bladder of Gymnarchus is cellular, very
extensible, and communicates with the dorsal side of the œsophagus by a
duct possessing a sphincter.</p>

</div>

<p>We know of no other group of fishes which offers so many difficulties
to the ichthyologist with regard to the distinction of the species
as well as to certain points in their life-history, as this genus,
although this may be partly due to the unusual attention which has been
given to their study, and which has revealed an almost greater amount
of unexplained facts than of satisfactory solutions of the questions
raised. The almost infinite variations of these fishes are dependent on
age, sex and sexual development, food, and the properties of the water.
Some of the species interbreed, and the hybrids mix again with one of
the parent species, thus producing an offspring more or less similar
to the pure breed. The <i>coloration</i> is, first of all, subject
to variation; and consequently this character but rarely assists in
distinguishing a species, there being not one which would show in all
stages of development the same kind of coloration. The young of all
the species are <i>barred</i>; and this is so constantly the case
that it may be used as a generic or even as a family character, not
being peculiar to <i>Salmo</i> alone, but also to <i>Thymallus</i>
and probably to <i>Coregonus</i>. The number of bars is not quite
constant, but the migratory Trout have two (and even three) more
than the River-Trout. In some waters River-trout<span class="pagenum" id="Page_632">[632]</span> remain small, and
frequently retain the Parr-marks all their lifetime; at certain seasons
a new coat of scales overlays the Parr-marks, rendering them invisible
for a time; but they reappear in time, or are distinct as soon as the
scales are removed. When the Salmones have passed this “Parr” state,
the coloration becomes much diversified. The males, especially during
and immediately after the spawning time, are more intensely coloured
and variegated than the females; specimens which have not attained to
maturity retaining a brighter silvery colour, and being more similar to
the female fish. Food appears to have less influence on the coloration
of the outer parts than on that of the flesh; thus the more variegated
specimens are frequently out of condition, whilst well-fed individuals
with pinkish flesh are of a more uniform though bright coloration.
Chemistry has not supplied us yet with an analysis of the substance
which gives the pink colour to the flesh of many Salmonoids; but
there is little doubt that it is identical with, and produced by, the
red pigments of many salt- and freshwater Crustaceans, which form a
favourite food of these fishes. The water has a marked influence on
the colours; Trout with intense ocellated spots are generally found in
clear rapid rivers, and in small open Alpine pools; in the large lakes
with pebbly bottom the fish are bright silvery, and the ocellated spots
are mixed with or replaced by X-shaped black spots; in pools or parts
of lakes with muddy or peaty bottom, the trout are of a darker colour
generally, and when enclosed in caves or holes, they may assume an
almost uniform blackish coloration.</p>

<p>The change of scales (that is, the rapid reproduction of the worn
part of the scales) coincides in the migratory species with their
sojourn in the sea. The renovated scales give them a bright silvery
appearance, most of the spots disappearing or being overlaid and hidden
by the silvery scales. Now, some of the species, like <i>S. fario</i>,
inhabit all the different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_633">[633]</span> waters indicated, even brackish water, and,
in consequence, we find a great variation of colour in one and the
same species; others are more restricted in their habitat, like <i>S.
salar</i>, <i>S. ferox</i>, etc., and, therefore, their coloration may
be more precisely defined.</p>

<p>With regard to <i>size</i> the various species do not present an
equal amount of variation. Size appears to depend on the abundance of
food and the extent of the water. Thus, the Salmon and the different
kinds of great Lake-trout do not appear to vary considerably in size,
because they find the same conditions in all the localities inhabited
by them. A widely spread species, however, like <i>S. fario</i>, when
it inhabits a small mountain pool with scanty food, may never exceed a
weight of eight ounces, whilst in a large lake or river, where it finds
an abundance and variety of food, it attains to a weight of fourteen
or sixteen pounds. Such large River-trout are frequently named and
described as Salmon-trout, Bull-trout, etc. Further, in Salmones, as
in the majority of fishes and tailed Batrachians, there is an innate
diversity of growth in individuals hatched from the same spawn. Some
grow rapidly and normally, others more slowly, and some remain dwarfed
and stationary at a certain stage of development.</p>

<p>The <i>proportions of the various parts of the body</i> to one another
vary exceedingly in one and the same species. Beside the usual changes
from the young to the sexually mature form observed in all fishes,
the snout undergoes an extraordinary amount of alteration of shape.
In the mature male the intermaxillaries and the mandible are produced
in various degrees, and the latter is frequently more or less bent
upwards. Hence the males have the snout much more pointed and produced,
and the entire head longer, than the females; with the intermaxillary
bone the teeth, with which it is armed, are also enlarged, sometimes to
four times the size of those of the females. And if this development of
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_634">[634]</span> front part of the head happens to be going on while the individual
is able to obtain only a scanty supply of food, the usual proportions
of the head and trunk are so altered that the species is very difficult
to recognise. Barren male fish approach the females in the proportions
of the head and body, but hybrid fishes do not differ in this respect
from their parents. The abundance or scarcity of food, and the
disposition or indisposition of the Salmonoids to feed, are other
causes affecting the growth or fulness of the various parts of the
body. In well-fed fishes the head is proportionally not only smaller
but also shorter, and <i>vice versa</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>fins</i> vary to a certain degree. The variation in the
number of the rays is inconsiderable and of no value for specific
distinction. The caudal fin undergoes considerable changes of form
with age, and dependency upon the sexual development. Young specimens
of all species have this fin more or less deeply excised, so that the
young of a species which has the caudal emarginate throughout life,
is distinguished by a deeper incision of the fin, from the young of a
species which has it truncate in the adult state. As the individuals of
a species do not all attain to maturity at the same age and at the same
size, and as mature individuals generally have the caudal less deeply
excised than immature ones of the same age and size, it is evident that
the variations in the form of the caudal are considerable and numerous,
and that it is a very misleading character if due regard be not paid to
the age and sexual development of the fish. Further, species inhabiting
rapid streams as well as still waters show considerable variations in
the form and length of all the fins; those individuals which live in
rapid streams, being in almost constant motion and wearing off the
delicate extremities of the fins, have the fin-rays comparatively
shorter and stouter, and the fins of a more rounded form, particularly
at the corners, than individuals inhabiting ponds or lakes. Moreover,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_635">[635]</span>
one and the same individual may pass a part of its life in a lake, and
enter a river at certain periods, thus changing the form of its fins
almost periodically.</p>

<p>Finally, to complete our enumeration of these variable characters, we
must mention that in old males, during and after the spawning-season,
the <i>skin</i> on the back becomes thickened and spongy, so that the
scales are quite invisible, being imbedded in the skin.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>After this cursory review of variable characters we pass on to those
which are more constant, not subject to ready modification by external
circumstances; and which, therefore, ought to be noticed in every
description of a species of Salmo.</p>

<p>1. <i>The form of the præoperculum of the adult fish.</i> The
præoperculum is composed of a vertical (posterior) and horizontal
(lower) part (limb), both meeting at a more or less rounded angle. The
development of the lower limb is a very constant character; in some
species (as in the Salmon) it is long, in others (<i>S. ferox</i>,
<i>S. brachypoma</i>) exceedingly short. The adjoining woodcuts will
readily show this difference.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="fig287" style="max-width: 235px">

     <p class="p0 center smaller">Fig. 287.—Præoperculum of A. Salmo salar; B. Salmo
brachypoma.</p>
  </div>

<p>In young specimens of all Salmonoids the præoperculum has a very short
lower limb; but whilst in some species it lengthens with age, its
development in a horizontal direction is arrested in others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_636">[636]</span></p>

<p>2. <i>The width and strength of the maxillary of the adult
fish.</i>—To show this character in two distinct species, we have
given woodcuts of the maxillaries of females (12 inches long) of <i>S.
fario</i> and <i>S. levenensis</i> of the same size.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="fig288" style="max-width: 480px">

     <p class="p0 center smaller">Fig. 288.—Maxillary of A. Salmo fario; B. Salmo
levenensis.</p>
  </div>

<p>In young specimens of all Salmonoids the maxillary is comparatively
shorter and broader, somewhat resembling that of <i>Coregonus</i>; yet
this bone offers a valuable character for the determination of the
young of some species; for instance, in a young <i>S. cambricus</i>
it extends scarcely to below the centre of the eye, whilst in <i>S.
fario</i> of the same size it reaches to, or even beyond, this point.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" id="fig289" style="max-width: 250px">

  </div>

<p>3. <i>The size of the teeth, those of the intermaxillaries excepted.</i></p>

<p>4. <i>The arrangement, and the permanence or deciduousness of the
vomerine teeth.</i>—In some species the vomer is normally armed with
a double or single series throughout life, although, of course, some
of the teeth are frequently accidentally lost; in others, these teeth
disappear gradually with age, the hinder ones first, so that finally
the anterior only remain. In order to ascertain the arrangement of
the teeth, it is necessary to remove the gengiva. Frequently the
teeth stand in a distinctly double or single series, or they are
placed alternately; but frequent irregularities occur which render<span class="pagenum" id="Page_637">[637]</span>
the character vague, or even unsafe, so that some zoologists have
rejected it entirely as unreliable. However, when a greater number of
individuals really belonging to the same species are examined, a pretty
safe conclusion may be arrived at as regards the arrangement of the
teeth.</p>

  </div>

<p>5. <i>The form of the caudal fin</i> in specimens of a given size, age,
and sexual development.</p>

<p>6. <i>A great development of the pectoral fins</i>, when constant in
individuals from the same locality.</p>

<p>7. <i>The size of the scales</i>, as indicated by the number of
transverse rows above the lateral line: one of the most constant
characters.</p>

<p>8. <i>The number of vertebræ.</i>—Considering the great number of
vertebræ in Salmonoids the constancy of this character is truly
surprising. An excess or a diminution of the normal number by two, is
of rare occurrence, and generally to be explained by the fact that
one vertebra has been abnormally divided into two, two such vertebræ
being considerably smaller than the others; or, on the other hand,
that two have merged into one centrum, which is then unusually large,
and provided with two neural spines. We have seen one case only, in
which three vertebræ were united. The number of vertebræ can be easily
ascertained in specimens destined for preservation in spirits, by an
incision made along one side of the fish, a little above the lateral
line.</p>

<p>9. <i>The number of pyloric appendages.</i>—There can be no doubt that
this character may materially assist in fixing a species. We shall see
that in some species it varies from 30 to 50; but in others, as in the
Salmon and Charr, it has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_638">[638]</span> found very constant (see Fig. <a href="#fig56">56</a>, p.
131). If unexpected variations occur, their cause may be found in a
partial confluence of the cæca, as we have observed that specimens of
<i>S. levenensis</i> (a species normally with from 70 to 90 cæca), had
those appendages of unusual width when the normal number was diminished.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>We have mentioned above that many points in the <i>life-history</i> of
the Salmonoids still remain very obscure:—</p>

<p>1. Johnson, a correspondent of Willughby (“Hist. Pisc.,” p. 194), had
already expressed his belief that the different Salmonoids interbreed;
and this view has since been shared by many who have observed these
fishes in nature. Hybrids between the Sewin (<i>S. cambricus</i>) and
the River Trout (<i>S. fario</i>) were numerous in the Rhymney and
other rivers of South Wales, before Salmonoids were almost exterminated
by the pollutions allowed to pass into those streams, and so variable
in their characters that the passage from one species to the other
could be demonstrated in an almost unbroken series, which might induce
some naturalists to regard both species as identical. Abundant evidence
of a similar character has accumulated, showing the frequent occurrence
of hybrids between <i>S. fario</i> and <i>S. trutta</i>; hybrids
between <i>S. fario</i> and species of Charr have been abundantly bred
by continental pisciculturists. In some rivers the conditions appear
to be more favourable to hybridism than in others, in which hybrids
are of comparatively rare occurrence. Hybrids between the Salmon and
some other species are very scarce everywhere. The hybrids are sexually
as much developed as the pure breed, but nothing whatever is known of
their further propagation and progeny.</p>

<p>2. Siebold has shown that some individuals of every species are not
sexually developed, and that such individuals differ also externally
from those normally developed. However,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_639">[639]</span> he appears to have gone too
far when he stated that this state of sterility extends over the whole
existence of such individuals, and that, therefore, the external
peculiarities also remain permanent throughout life. According to
Widegren this sterility is merely a temporary immaturity, and a part of
the individuals arrive at a full sexual development at a later or much
later period than others. To this we may add that many Salmonoids cease
to propagate their species after a certain age, and that all so called
overgrown individuals (that is, specimens much exceeding the usual size
of the species) are barren. Externally they retain the normal specific
characters.</p>

<p>The Salmon offers a most remarkable instance of irregularity as
regards the age at which the individuals arrive at maturity. Shaw
has demonstrated, in the most conclusive manner, that those small
Salmonoids, which are generally called Parr, are the offspring of the
Salmon, and that many males, from 7 to 8 inches long, have their sexual
organs fully developed, and that their milt has all the impregnating
properties of the seminal fluid of a much older and larger fish. That
this Parr is not a distinct species—as has been again maintained by
Couch—is further proved by the circumstance that these sexually mature
Parr are absolutely identical in their zoological characters with the
immature Parr, which are undoubtedly young Salmon, and that no Parr
has ever been found with mature ova. But whether these Parr produce
normal Salmon, impregnating the ova of female salmon, or mingle with
the River-trout, or whether they continue to grow and propagate their
species as fully developed Salmon, are questions which remain to be
answered. We may only add that, as far as we know, barren old Salmon
are extremely scarce.</p>

<p>3. The question whether any of the migratory species can be retained
by artificial means in fresh water, and finally accommodate themselves
to a permanent sojourn therein,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_640">[640]</span> must be negatived for the present.
Several instances of successful experiments made for this purpose
have been brought forward; but all these accounts are open to serious
doubts, inasmuch as they do not afford us sufficient proof that
the young fish introduced into ponds were really young migratory
Salmonoids, or that the full-grown specimens were identical with those
introduced, and not hybrids or non-migratory Trout of a somewhat
altered appearance in consequence of the change of their locality.
We have seen the experiment tried at two places in South Wales, and
in both cases the Salmon and the pure Sewin died when not allowed to
return to the sea. On the other hand, hybrid fishes from the Sewin and
the Trout survived the experiment, and continued to grow in a pond
perfectly shut up from communication with the sea. In that locality
neither those hybrids nor the trout spawn.</p>

<p>4. Although the majority of the mature individuals of a migratory
species ascend a river at a certain fixed time before the commencement
of spawning, others enter the freshwater at a much earlier period,
either singly or in small troops; and many appear to return to the sea
before they reascend at the time of the regular immigration. It is
not improbable that one and the same individual may change the salt-
or freshwater several times in the year. However, this is the case in
certain rivers only, for instance, in those falling into the Moray
Firth; in others one immigration only is known to occur. The cause of
the irregular ascents previous to the autumnal ascents is unknown. A
part, at least, of the hybrid fishes retain the migratory instinct; but
it is not known whether sterile individuals accompany the others in
their migrations.</p>

<p>5. It is said that the migratory species invariably return to the river
in which they are bred. Experiments have shown that this is normally
the case; but a small proportion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_641">[641]</span> appear to stray so far away from
their native place as to be unable to find their way back. Almost every
year Salmon and Sea-trout in the Grilse-state make their appearance at
the mouth of the Thames (where the migrating Salmonoids have become
extinct for many years), ready to reascend and to restock this river as
soon as its poisoned water shall be sufficiently purified to allow them
a passage.</p>

<p>6. There has been much dispute about the time required for the growth
of Salmonoids. The numerous and apparently contradictory observations
tend to show that there is a great amount of variation even among
individuals of the same origin living under the same circumstances,
some of them growing much more quickly than others, and being ready to
descend to the sea twelve months before their brethren. The cause of
this irregularity is not explained. On the other hand, when we consider
the fibrous condition of the Salmonoid skeleton, which is much less
solid, and more wanting in calcareous substance, than that of the
majority of Teleosteous fishes, we shall be quite prepared to adopt the
truth of the observation that the young Salmonoids return to the fresh
water, after a few months sojourn in the sea, and after having feasted
on nourishing Crustaceans, Sand-eels, etc., with their former weight in
ounces increased to pounds.</p>

<p>7. Liability to variation in form indicates that an animal can adapt
itself to a variety of circumstances; therefore, such species as show
the greatest pliability in this respect, are those which most recommend
themselves for domestication and acclimatisation within certain
climatic limits. Thus, the River-trout or Sea-trout were very proper
subjects for those eminently successful attempts to establish them in
similar latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere, whilst the attempt of
transferring them into the low hill-streams of India ended (as could be
foreseen) in a total failure. Those two species must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_642">[642]</span> now be considered
to be fully acclimatised in Tasmania and New Zealand, and with but
little protection may be expected to hold their own in the freshwaters
of those colonies. Whether the acclimatisation of the Salmon will be
in the end equally and permanently successful, remains to be seen.
The true <i>S. salar</i> is not subject to variation, and is very
sensitive to any change of external conditions, and to every kind of
interference with its economy. The fourth species, with which attempts
of acclimatisation in Southern Australia have been made, is a migratory
Salmon from the Sacramento river in California. This experiment is
still in progress, and believed to be promising of success. It will be
a most curious problem to ascertain, how much the original characters
and habits of those species will be affected by their transference to
so distant a part of the globe. At present it would be too hazardous
to offer an opinion on this point, especially as it is a fact that
numerous cross-breeds have been introduced into, and reared in,
Tasmania, which must more or less interfere with the characters of the
pure breeds.</p>

<p>It is apparent, from the foregoing remarks, that the distinction
of the various species of Salmonidæ is a matter of considerable
difficulty, and that there is scope for great diversity of opinion.
At any rate it is only by a close, long-continued study, and constant
comparison of specimens of various ages and from various localities,
that one is enabled to find a guide through the labyrinth of confusing
variations. However, it is a significant fact that the very same
characters by which we are enabled to distinguish European species
occur again, though in an exaggerated form, in American Salmonoids
(which everybody will admit to be of distinct species), and therefore
our faith in them necessarily becomes strengthened. In accordance with
acknowledged principles in zoology, forms which differ from their
congeners by a combination of two or more of constant characters, are
to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_643">[643]</span> distinguished under distinct specific names. Most likely they
have been derived, at a not very remote period, from common ancestors,
but the question of their specific distinctness is no more affected
by this consideration than the question whether <i>Salmo</i> and
<i>Coregonus</i> are distinct genera. Whenever the zoologist observes
two forms distinguished by peculiarities of organisation, such as
cannot be conceived to be the effects of an external or internal cause,
disappearing with the disappearance of that cause, and which forms
have been propagated and are being propagated uniformly through all
the generations within the limits of our observations, and are yet
most probably to be propagated during the existence of mankind, he is
obliged to describe these forms as distinct, and they will commonly be
called species.</p>

<p>The species of the genus <i>Salmo</i> are inhabitants of the temperate
and arctic zones of the Northern Hemisphere; the species are most
abundant in the northern parts of the temperate zone, becoming scarcer
beyond the Arctic circle, and in the warmer parts towards the south.
The southernmost points in which Salmones are found, are, on the
American continent, the rivers falling into the head of the Californian
Gulf, and in the Old World the mountain rivers of the Atlas and Hindu
Kush. The Salmones from those localities are migratory Trout in the New
World, non-migratory and small in the Old. Those species which range
to the highest latitudes (lat. 82°) belong to the division of Charr, a
group which generally are more intolerant of a moderate temperature,
than real Trout. The genus is subdivided into</p>

<p>1. <i>S. salar</i> (Salmon; Lachs or Salm; Saumon) (Fig. <a href="#fig6">6</a>,
p. 43). The Salmon can generally be readily recognised, but
there are instances in which the identification of specimens is
doubtful, and in which the following characters (besides others)
will be of great assistance. The tail is covered with relatively
large scales, there being constantly eleven, or sometimes twelve
in a transverse series running from behind the adipose fin
forwards to the lateral line, whilst there are from thirteen to
fifteen in the different kinds of Sea-trout and River-trout. The
number of pyloric appendages (see Fig. <a href="#fig56">56</a>, p. 131) is great,
generally between 60 and 70, more rarely falling to 53 or rising
to 77. The body of the vomer is armed with a single series of
small teeth, which at an early age are gradually lost from
behind towards the front, so that half-grown and old individuals
have only a few (1–4) left. The Salmon inhabits temperate Europe
southwards to 43° N. lat., and is not found in any of the rivers
falling into the Mediterranean. In the New World its southern
boundary is 41° N. lat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_647">[647]</span></p>

<p>The “Smelt” (<i>O. eperlanus</i>) is common on many places of the
coasts of Northern Europe and America. In the sea it grows to a length
of eight inches; but, singularly, it frequently migrates from the sea
into rivers and lakes, where its growth is very much retarded. That
this habit is one of very old date, is evident from the fact that
this small freshwater form occurs, and is fully acclimatised in lakes
which have now no open communication with the sea. And still more
singularly, this same habit, with the same result, has been observed in
the Smelt of New Zealand (<i>Retropinna richardsonii</i>). The Smelt
is considered a delicacy in Europe, as well as in America, where the
same species occurs. Two other allied genera, <i>Hypomesus</i> and
<i>Thaleichthys</i>, are found on the Pacific coast of North America,
the latter being caught in immense numbers, and known by the name
“Eulachon” and “Oulachan;” it is so fat, that it is equally used as
food and as candle.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Mallotus.</span>—Body covered with minute scales, which are
somewhat larger along the lateral line and along each side

lamelliform, extending to below the middle of the eye. Lower jaw

<p>The majority of the species, of which more than forty are known, are
lacustrine species; and comparatively few are subject to periodical
migrations to the sea, like <i>Salmo</i>. They are confined to the
northern parts of temperate Europe, Asia, and North America. Their
distribution is local, but sometimes three and more species are found
in the same lake. They abound in every lake and river of the northern
parts of North America, and are known by the name of “White-fish.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_649">[649]</span>
They are of vital importance to some tribes of the native population.
The European <i>C. oxyrhynchus</i> is as much a marine as a freshwater
species. In the British Islands several small species occur, viz. <i>C.
clupeoides</i>, the “Gwyniad,” “Schelly,” or “Powen” from the great
lakes; <i>C. vandesius</i>, the “Vendace” of Lochmaben; and <i>C.
pollan</i>, the “Pollan” of the Irish lakes. The latter is brought in
quantities to Belfast market during the season, that is, at the time
when it rises from the depths of Lough Neagh to deposit its spawn near
the shore. Thomson says that in September 1834 some 17,000 were taken
there at three or four draughts of the net. Some of the species of the
continent of Europe and America attain to a much larger size than the
British species, viz. to a length of two feet.</p>

<p>This small, transparent, or whitish fish <i>(S. chinensis</i>) is well
known at Canton and other places of the coast of China as “White-bait,”

considerable depth in the sea, and approaches the coast only at certain
seasons.</p>

<p>Finally, this family is represented in the deep sea by three genera,
<i>Argentina</i>, <i>Microstoma</i>, and <i>Bathylagus</i>, of which
the two former live at moderate depths, and have been known for a long
time, whilst the last was discovered during the “Challenger” expedition
in the Atlantic and Antarctic Oceans at depths of 1950 and 2040
fathoms. As <i>Argentina</i> is sometimes found in the North Atlantic,

is cellular, and the stomach consists of a membranous and a muscular
portion.</p>


<h6 class="smcap">Twenty-Second Family—Clupeidæ.</h6>

<p><i>Body covered with scales; head naked; barbels none. Abdomen
frequently compressed into a serrated edge. Margin of the upper jaw
formed by the intermaxillaries mesially, and by the maxillaries
laterally; maxillaries composed of at least three movable pieces.
Opercular apparatus complete. Adipose fin none. Dorsal not elongate;
anal sometimes very long. Stomach with a blind sac; pyloric appendages
numerous. Gill-apparatus much developed, the gill-openings being
generally very wide. Pseudobranchiæ generally present. Air-bladder more
or less simple.</i></p>

<p>The family of “Herrings” is probably unsurpassed by any other in
the number of individuals, although others comprise a much greater
variety of species. The Herrings are principally coast-fishes, or,
at least, do not go far from the shore; none belong to the deep-sea
fauna; scarcely any have pelagic habits, but many enter or live in
fresh waters communicating with the sea. They are spread over all
the temperate and tropical zones. Fossil remains of Herrings are
numerous, but the pertinence of some of the genera to this family
is open to serious doubts, as the remains are too fragmentary to
allow of determining whether they belong to Salmonoids or Clupeoids.
Therefore, Agassiz comprised both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_656">[656]</span> families in one—<i>Halecidæ</i>.
Many of the remains belong to recent genera, which are readily
recognised, as <i>Clupea</i>, <i>Engraulis</i> and <i>Chanos</i>,
principally from the schists of Glaris and Licata, from Monte
Bolca and the Lebanon. Others, like <i>Thrissopater</i>, from the
Gault at Folkestone, <i>Leptosomus</i>, <i>Opisthopteryx</i>,
<i>Spaniodon</i>, from the chalk and tertiary formations, can be
readily associated with recent genera. But the majority do not show
an apparent affinity to the present fauna. Thus, <i>Halec</i> from
the chalk of Bohemia, <i>Platinx</i> and <i>Coelogaster</i> from
Monte Bolca, <i>Rhinellus</i> from Monte Bolca and Mount Lebanon,
<i>Scombroclupea</i>, with finlets behind the anal, from the Lebanon
and Comen, and <i>Crossognathus</i> from tertiary Swiss formations,
allied to <i>Megalops</i>, <i>Spathodactylus</i> from the same
locality, and <i>Chirocentrites</i> from Mount Lebanon, etc. Finally,
a genus recently discovered in tertiary formations of Northern Italy,
<i>Hemitrichas</i>, has been classed with the Clupeoids, from which,
however, it differs by having two short dorsal fins, so that it must
be considered, without doubt, to be the representative of a distinct
family.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Engraulis</span> (including <span class="smcap">Cetengraulis</span>).—Scales
large or of moderate size. Snout more or less conical,
projecting beyond the lower jaw. Teeth small or rudimentary.
Intermaxillaries very small, hidden; maxillary long, attached
to the cheek by a scarcely distensible membrane. Anal fin of
moderate or great length. Branchiostegals short, from nine to
fourteen in number.</p>
</div>

<p>Not less than forty-three different species of “Anchovies” are known
from temperate and tropical seas. They exhibit marked differences in
the length of their maxillary bone, which sometimes does not reach
the gill-opening, whilst in other species it extends far beyond it;
and in the number of their anal rays, which varies from 20 to 80.
Some have the upper pectoral ray prolonged into a filament, thus
leading towards the succeeding genus, <i>Coilia</i>. The majority
are recognised, besides, by their peculiar structure, by a broad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_657">[657]</span>
silvery, lateral band, similar to that observed in the Atherines. The
most celebrated Anchovy is <i>E. encrasicholus</i>, very plentiful
in the Mediterranean, but rarely wandering northwards. It is the
species which, preserved in salt, is exported to all parts of the
world, although similarly lucrative fisheries of Anchovies might be
established in Tasmania where the same species occurs, in Chile, China,
Japan, California, at Buenos Ayres, each of which countries possesses
Anchovies by no means inferior to the Mediterranean species.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Coilia.</span>—Body terminating in a long tapering tail.
Scales of moderate size. Snout and jaws as in <i>Engraulis</i>.
Anal fin exceedingly long, confluent with the caudal. The two or
three upper pectoral rays are much prolonged, and their branches
form four, six, or seven filaments.</p>

<p>Ten species from Indian and Chinese seas.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Chatoëssus.</span>—Body compressed; abdomen serrated. Scales
of moderate size. Snout obtuse, or obtusely conical, more or
less projecting beyond the cleft of the mouth, which is narrow,
more or less transverse. Maxillary joined to the ethmoid, its
upper portion being behind the intermaxillary. Teeth none.
Anal fin rather long; dorsal opposite to the ventrals, or to
the space between ventrals and anal. Gill-membranes entirely
separate; branchial arches forming two angles, one pointing
forward and the other backwards; the fourth branchial arch with
an accessory organ; branchiostegals of moderate length, five or
six in number.</p>
</div>

<p>Ten species from the coasts, brackish and fresh waters of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_658">[658]</span> Central
America (one species ranges to New York), Australia, the East Indies,
and Japan.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Clupea.</span>—Body compressed, with the abdomen serrated,
the serrature extending forwards to the thorax. Scales of
moderate or large, rarely of small size. Upper jaw not
projecting beyond the lower. Cleft of the mouth of moderate
width. Teeth, if present, rudimentary and deciduous. Anal fin of
moderate extent, with less than thirty rays; dorsal fin opposite
to the ventrals. Caudal forked.</p>
</div>

<p>This genus comprises more than sixty different species, the
geographical distribution of which coincides with that of the family.
The majority are of greater or less utility to man, but a few tropical
species (<i>C. thrissa</i>, <i>C. venenosa</i>, and others) acquire,
probably from their food, highly poisonous properties, so as to
endanger the life of persons eating them. The most noteworthy species
are—</p>

<p>1. <i>C. harengus</i> (the “Herring”).—It is readily recognised by
having an ovate patch of very small teeth on the vomer. D. 17–20. A.
16–18. L. lat. 53–59. Vert. 56. Gill-cover smooth, without radiating
ridges. It inhabits, in incredible numbers, the German Ocean, the
northern parts of the Atlantic, and the seas north of Asia. The Herring
of the Atlantic coasts of North America is identical with that of
Europe. A second species has been supposed to exist on the British
coast (<i>C. leachii</i>), but it comprises only individuals of a
smaller size, the produce of an early or late spawn. Also the so-called
“White-bait” is not a distinct species, but consists chiefly of the fry
or the young of herrings, and is obtained “in perfection” at localities
where these small fishes find an abundance of food, as in the estuary
of the Thames.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_659">[659]</span></p>

<p>2. <i>C. mirabilis.</i>—The Herring of the North Pacific.</p>

<p>3. <i>C. sprattus.</i>—The “Sprat.” Without vomerine teeth. D. 15–18.
A. 17–20. L. lat. 47–48. Vert. 47–49. Gill-cover, smooth, without
radiating ridges. Abundant on the Atlantic coasts of Europe.</p>

<p>4. <i>C. thrissa.</i>—One of the most common West Indian fishes,
distinguished by the last dorsal ray being prolonged into a filament.
Hyrtl has discovered a small accessory branchial organ in this species.</p>

<p>5. <i>C. alosa.</i>—The “Shad” or “Allice Shad,” with very fine and
long gill-rakers, from 60 to 80 on the horizontal part of the outer
branchial arch, and with one or more black lateral blotches. Coasts of
Europe, ascending rivers.</p>

<p>6. <i>C. finta.</i>—The “Shad” or “Twaite Shad,” with stout osseous
gill-rakers, from 21 to 27 on the horizontal part of the outer
branchial arch, and spotted like the preceding species. Coasts of
Europe, ascending rivers, and found in abundance in the Nile.</p>

<p>7. <i>C. menhaden.</i>—The “Mossbanker,” common on the Atlantic coasts
of the United States. The economic value of this fish is surpassed
in America only by that of the Gadoids, and derived chiefly from its
use as bait for other fishes, and from the oil extracted from it, the
annual yield of the latter exceeding that of the whale (from American
Fisheries). The refuse of the oil factories supplies a material of much
value for artificial manures.</p>

<p>8. <i>C. sapidissima.</i>—The American Shad, abundant, and an
important food-fish on the Atlantic coasts of North America. Spawns in
fresh water.</p>

<p>9. <i>C. mattowocca.</i>—The “Gaspereau” or “Ale-wife,” common on the
Atlantic coasts of North America, ascending into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_660">[660]</span> freshwater in early
spring, and spawning in ponds and lakes.</p>

<p>10. <i>C. pilchardus.</i>—The “Pilchard” or the “Sardine,” equally
abundant in the British Channel, on the coast of Portugal, and in
the Mediterranean, and readily recognised by radiating ridges on the
operculum, descending towards the sub-operculum.</p>

<p>11. <i>C. sagax.</i>—Representing the Pilchard in the Pacific, and
found in equally large shoals on the coasts of California, Chile, New
Zealand, and Japan.</p>

<p>12. <i>C. toli.</i>—The subject of a very extensive fishery on the
coast of Sumatra for the sake of its roes, which are salted and
exported to China, the dried fish themselves being sent into the
interior of the island. The fish is called “Trubu” by the Malays,
about 18 inches long, and it is said that between fourteen and fifteen
millions are caught annually.</p>

<p>13. <i>C. scombrina.</i>—The “Oil-Sardine” of the eastern coast of the
Indian Peninsula.</p>

<p>Other, but less important genera of Clupeoids with serrated abdomen,
are <i>Clupeoides</i>, <i>Pellonula</i>, <i>Clupeichthys</i>,

<p>One genus and species only (<i>Bathythrissa dorsalis</i>) from deep
water (350 fathoms) off the coast of Japan. This remarkable fish has
the appearance of a <i>Coregonus</i>, and attains to a length of two
feet. Nothing is known of its osteology, but possibly a fossil genus
from the Gyps of Montmartre; <i>Notæus</i>, which has also a long

<p>Before the voyage of the “Challenger” one species only of this family

Mediterranean; now, four genera with seven species are known, and
there is no doubt that this family is one of the most characteristic,
and will prove to be one of the most generally distributed
forms, of the deep-sea. Their vertical range varies between 345
(<i>Xenodermichthys</i>) and 2150 (<i>Bathytroctes</i>) fathoms. They
approach the Salmonoids, but lack invariably the adipose fin. Their
dentition is very feeble; their eye large; bones thin. Coloration black.</p>

<p>One genus only (<i>Notopterus</i>) with five species which inhabit
fresh waters of the East Indies and West Africa. Well-preserved remains
of this genus occur in the marl slates of Padang, in Sumatra. Their

horns anteriorly and posteriorly, the anterior horns being in direct
connection with the auditory organ.</p>


<h6 class="smcap">Twenty-seventh Family—Halosauridæ.</h6>

<p><i>Body covered with cycloid scales; head scaly; barbels none. Margin

<i>Leptotrachelus</i>, <i>Pelargorhynchus</i>, <i>Plinthophorus</i>,
<i>Saurorhamphus</i> (with the lower jaw longest), <i>Eurypholis</i>;

<p>The “Electric Eel” is the most powerful of electric fishes, growing to
a length of six feet, and extremely abundant in certain localities of
Brazil and the Guyanas. The electric organ consists of two pairs of
longitudinal bodies, situated immediately below the skin, above the
muscles; one pair on the back of the tail, and the other pair along
the anal fin. Each fasciculus is composed of flat partitions or septa,
with transverse divisions between them. The outer edge of the septa
appear in nearly parallel lines in the direction of the longitudinal
axis of the body, and consist of thin membranes, which are easily torn;
they serve the same purpose as the columns in the analogous organ
of the Torpedo, making the walls or abutments for the perpendicular
and transverse dissepiments, which are exceedingly numerous, and so
closely aggregated as to seem almost in contact. The minute prismatic
cells, intercepted between these two sorts of plates, contain a
gelatinous matter; the septa are about one-thirtieth of an inch from
each other, and one inch in length contains a series of 240 cells,
giving an enormous surface to the electric organs. The whole apparatus
is supplied with more than 200 nerves,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_668">[668]</span> which are the continuations of
the rami anteriores of the spinal nerves. In their course they give out
branches to the muscles of the back, and to the skin of the animal.
In the Gymnotus, as in the Torpedo, the nerves supplying the electric
organs are much larger than those bestowed on any part for the purposes
of sensation or movement.</p>

<p>The graphic description by Humboldt of the capture of Electric Eels
by horses driven into the water, which would receive the electric
discharges and thus exhaust the fishes, seems to rest either on the
imagination of some person who told it to the great traveller or on
some isolated incident. Recent travellers have not been able to verify
it even in the same parts of the country where the practice was said to
exist.</p>


<h6 class="smcap">Thirtieth Family—Symbranchidæ.</h6>

<p><i>Body elongate, naked or covered with minute scales; barbels none.
Margin of the upper jaw formed by the intermaxillaries only, the well
developed maxillaries lying behind and parallel to them. Paired fins
none. Vertical fins rudimentary, reduced to more or less distinct
cutaneous folds. Vent situated at a, great distance behind the head.
Ribs present. Gill-openings confluent into one slit situated on the
ventral surface. Air-bladder none. Stomach without cæcal sac or pyloric
appendages. Ovaries with oviducts.</i></p>

<p>The fishes of this family consist of freshwater-fishes from tropical
America and Asia, which, however, enter also brackish water; and of a
truly marine genus from Australia.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Amphipnous.</span>—Vent in the posterior half of the body,
which is covered with minute scales longitudinally arranged.</p>
</div>

<p>A common fish (<i>A. cuchia</i>) in Bengal, remarkable for its
singular respiratory apparatus. It has only three branchial arches,
with rudimentary branchial laminæ, and with very narrow slits between
the arches. To supplement this insufficient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_669">[669]</span> respiratory apparatus, a
lung-like sac is developed on each side of the body behind the head,
opening between the hyoid and first branchial arch. The interior of the
sac is abundantly provided with blood-vessels, the arterial coming from
the branchial arteries, whilst those issuing from it unite to form the
aorta. <i>A. cuchia</i> approaches the Eels in having the humeral arch
not attached to the skull.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Monopterus.</span>—Vent in the posterior half of the body,

<h6 class="smcap">Thirty-First Family—Murænidæ.</h6>

<p><i>Body elongate, cylindrical or “band-shaped, naked or with
rudimentary scales. Vent situated at a great distance from the head.
Ventral fins none. Vertical fins, if present, confluent, or separated
by the projecting tip of the tail. Sides of the upper jaw formed by the
tooth-bearing maxillaries, the fore part by the intermaxillary, which
is more or less coalescent with the vomer and ethmoid. Humeral arch not
attached to the skull. Stomach with a blind sac; no pyloric appendages.
Organs of reproduction without efferent ducts.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_670">[670]</span></p>

<p>The “Eels” are spread over almost all fresh waters and seas of the
temperate and tropical zones; some descend to the greatest depths
of the oceans. The young of some have a limited pelagic existence.
(<i>Leptocephali</i>, see p. 179.) At Monte Bolca fossil remains
are very numerous, belonging to recent genera, <i>Anguilla</i>,
<i>Sphagebranchus</i>, and <i>Ophichthys</i>; even larval Leptocephales
have been preserved. <i>Anguilla</i> has been found also in the chalk
of Aix and Oeningen.</p>

<p>In the majority of the species the branchial openings in the pharynx
are wide slits (<i>Murænidæ platyschistæ</i>); in others, the true
Murænæ, (<i>Murænidæ engyschistæ</i>) they are narrow.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Nemichthys.</span>—Exceedingly elongate, band-shaped; tail
tapering into a point. Vent approximate to the pectorals,
but the abdominal cavity extending far behind the vent. Jaws
produced into a long slender bill, the upper part being formed
by the vomer and intermaxillaries. The inner surface of the
bill covered with small tooth-like asperities. Eye large. The
nostrils of each side are close together, in a hollow before the
eye. Gill-openings wide, nearly confluent. Pectoral and vertical
fins well developed.</p>
</div>

<p>This very singular type is a deep-sea form, occurring at depths of from
500 to 2500 fathoms. The two species known have hitherto been found in
the Atlantic only.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Cyema.</span>—This genus combines the form of the snout
of <i>Nemichthys</i>, with the soft and shorter body of a
<i>Leptocephalus</i>; but the gill-openings are very narrow
and close together on the abdominal surface. Vent in about the
middle of the length of the body; vertical fins well developed,
confined to, and surrounding, the tail. Pectoral fins well
developed. Eye very small.</p>
</div>

<p>Known from two specimens only, 4½ inches long, dredged in depths of
1500 and 1800 fathoms in the Pacific and Antarctic Oceans.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Saccopharynx.</span>—Deep-sea Congers, with the muscular
system very feebly developed, with the bones very thin, soft,
and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_671">[671]</span> wanting in inorganic matter. Head and gape enormous. Snout
very short, pointed, flexible, like an appendage overlapping
the gape. Maxillary and mandibulary bones very thin, slender,
arched, armed with one or two series of long, slender, curved,
widely set teeth, their points being directed inwards; palate
toothless. Gill-openings wide, at some distance from the head,
at the lower part of the sides; gills very narrow, free, and
exposed. Trunk of moderate length. Stomach distensible in
an extraordinary degree. Vent at the end of the trunk. Tail
band-like, exceedingly long, tapering in a very fine filament.
Pectoral small, present. Dorsal and anal fins rudimentary.</p>
</div>

<p>This is another extraordinary form of Deep-sea Eels; the muscular
system, except on the head, is very feebly developed; the bones
are as thin, soft, and wanting in inorganic matter, as in the
<i>Trachypteridæ</i>. This fish is known from three specimens only,
which have been found floating on the surface of the North Atlantic,
with their stomachs much distended, having swallowed some other fish,
the weight of which many times exceeded that of their destroyer. It
attains to the length of several feet.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Synaphobranchus.</span>—Gill-openings ventral, united
into a longitudinal slit between the pectoral fins, separate
internally. Pectoral and vertical fins well developed. Nostrils
lateral, the anterior subtubular, the posterior round, before
the lower half of the eye. Cleft of the mouth very wide; teeth
small; body scaly. Stomach very distensible.</p>
</div>

<p>Deep-sea Congers, with well-developed muscular system, spread over
all oceans, and occurring in depths of from 345 to 2000 fathoms. Four
species are known. Probably attaining to the same length as the Conger.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Anguilla.</span>—Small scales imbedded in the skin. Upper jaw
not projecting beyond the lower. Teeth small, forming bands.
Gill-openings narrow, at the base of the pectoral fins. The
dorsal fin commences at a considerable distance from the occiput.</p>
</div>

<p>Some twenty-five species of “Eels” are known from the freshwaters and
coasts of the temperate and tropical zones;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_672">[672]</span> none have been found in
South America or the west coast of North America and West Africa.
The following are the most noteworthy:—The common European species
(<i>A. anguilla</i>) is spread over Europe to 64° 30´ lat. N., and all
round the Mediterranean area, but is not found either in the Danube
or in the Black and Caspian Seas; it extends across the Atlantic to
North America. The form of the snout varies much, and some naturalists
have believed that specimens with a broad and obtuse snout were
specifically distinct from those with pointed snout. However, every
degree of breadth of the snout may be observed; and a much safer
way of recognizing this species, and distinguishing it from other
European Eels, is the forward position of the dorsal fin; the distance
between the commencement of the dorsal and anal fins being as long as,
or somewhat longer than, the head. Eels grow generally to a length
of about three feet, but the capture of much larger examples is on
record. Their mode of propagation is still unknown. So much only is
certain that they do not spawn in fresh water, that many full-grown
individuals, but not all, descend rivers during the winter months, and
that some of them at least must spawn in brackish water or in deep
water in the sea; for in the course of the summer young individuals
from three to five inches long ascend rivers in incredible numbers,
overcoming all obstacles, ascending vertical walls or floodgates,
entering every larger and smaller tributary, and making their way
even over terra firma to waters shut off from all communication
with rivers. Such immigrations have been long known by the name of
“<i>Eel-fairs</i>.” The majority of the Eels which migrate to the sea
appear to return to fresh water, but not in a body, but irregularly,
and throughout the warmer part of the year. No naturalist has ever
observed these fishes in the act of spawning, or found mature ova; and
the organs of reproduction of individuals caught in fresh water are
so little developed and so much alike, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_673">[673]</span> the female organ can be
distinguished from the male only with the aid of a microscope.</p>

<p>The second species found in Great Britain, on the coasts of Europe
generally, in China, New Zealand, and the West Indies, is (<i>A.
latirostris</i>) the “Grig” or “Glut,” which prefers the neighbourhood
of the sea to distant inland-waters, and in which the dorsal fin begins
farther backwards, the distance between the commencement of the dorsal
and anal fins being shorter than the head; its snout seems to be always
broad. On the American side of the Atlantic other species, beside <i>A.
anguilla</i> are found in abundance: <i>A. bostoniensis</i>, <i>A.
texana</i>. The largest Eels occur in lakes of the islands of the
Indo-Pacific, and they play a conspicuous part in the mythology of the
South-Sea Islanders and Maories; individuals of from eight to ten feet
in length have been seen, and referred to several species, as <i>A.
mauritiana</i>, <i>fidjiensis</i>, <i>obscura</i>, <i>aneitensis</i>,
etc.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Conger.</span>—Scaleless. Cleft of the mouth wide, extending
at least to below the middle of the eye. Maxillary and
mandibulary teeth arranged in series, one of which contains
teeth of equal size, and so closely set as to form a cutting
edge. No canine teeth. Vomerine band of teeth short. Pectoral
and vertical fins well developed, the dorsal commencing behind
the root of the pectoral. Gill-openings large, approximate to
the abdomen. The posterior nostril opposite to the upper or
middle part of the orbit, the anterior in a tube. Eyes well
developed.</p>
</div>

<p>The “Congers” are marine Eels; the best known species (<i>C.
conger</i>) seems to be almost cosmopolitan, and is plentiful all round
Europe, at St. Helena, in Japan, and Tasmania. It attains to a length
of eight feet, and thrives and grows rapidly even in confinement,
which is not the case with the freshwater Eel. Three other species are
known, of which <i>C. marginatus</i> from the Indian Ocean, is the most
common. <i>Leptocephalus morrisii</i> is an abnormal larval condition
of the Conger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_674">[674]</span></p>

<p>Genera allied to <i>Conger</i> are <i>Poeciloconger</i>,
<i>Congromurcæna</i>, <i>Uroconger</i>, and <i>Heteroconger</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Murænesox.</span>—Scaleless. Snout produced. Jaws with
several series of small closely set teeth, anteriorly with
canines; vomer with several long series of teeth, the middle
of which is formed by large conical or compressed teeth.
Gill-openings wide, approximate to the abdomen. Pectoral and
vertical fins well developed, the dorsal beginning above the
gill-opening. Two pairs of nostrils, the posterior opposite to
the upper part or middle of the eye.</p>
</div>

<p>Four species from tropical seas, <i>M. cinereus</i> being very common
in the Indian Ocean, and attaining to a length of six feet.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Nettastoma.</span>—Scaleless. Snout much produced, depressed.
Jaws and vomer with bands of card-like teeth, those along
the median line of the vomer being somewhat the larger.
Vertical fins well developed; pectorals none. Gill-openings
of moderate width, open. Nostrils on the upper surface of the
head, valvular; the anterior near to the end of the snout, the
posterior above the anterior angle of the eye.</p>
</div>

<p>This genus lives at some depth, the Japanese species (<i>N.
parviceps</i>) having been obtained at 345 fathoms. <i>N. melanurum</i>
from the Mediterranean, seems to inhabit a similar depth.
<i>Hyoprorus</i> is its Leptocephalid form.</p>

<p>Genera allied to <i>Murcænesox</i> are <i>Saurenchelys</i>,
<i>Oxyconger</i>, <i>Hoplunnis</i>, and <i>Neoconger</i>; in all these
the nostrils have a superior or lateral position. In other genera the
nostrils perforate the upper lip, as in <i>Myrus</i>, <i>Myrophis</i>,
<i>Paramyrus</i>, <i>Chilorhinus</i>, <i>Murænichthys</i>, and
<i>Ophichthys</i>, the last genus deserving of particular mention on
account of its great range and common occurrence.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Ophichthys.</span>—Nostrils labial; extremity of the tail
free, not surrounded by a fin.</p>
</div>

<p>More than eighty species are known, many of which are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_675">[675]</span> abundant on the
coasts of the tropical and sub-tropical zones. They do not attain to
a large size, but many must be extremely voracious and destructive to
other fishes, if we draw an inference from the formidable dentition
with which their jaws and palate is armed. Other species have much
more feeble, and some even obtuse teeth, better adapted for seizing
Crustaceans than vigorous and slippery fishes. Some have rudimentary
pectoral fins or lack them altogether. Many are highly ornamented with
bands or spots, the coloration being apparently very constant in the
several species.</p>

  </div>

<p>The Murænas are as abundantly represented in the tropical
and sub-tropical zones, and have nearly the same range, as
<i>Ophichthys</i>. The number of species known exceeds eighty. The
majority are armed with formidable pointed teeth, well suited for
seizing other fish on which they prey. Large specimens thus armed
readily attack persons in and out of the water; and as some species
attain a length of some six or eight feet, they are justly feared by
fishermen. The minority of species have obtuse and molar-like teeth,
their food consisting chiefly of Crustaceans and other hard-shelled
animals. Most of the Murænas are beautifully coloured and spotted, some
in a regular and constant manner, whilst in others the pattern varies
in a most irregular fashion: they have quite the appearance of snakes.
The Muræna of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_677">[677]</span> Ancient Romans is <i>Muræna helena</i>, which is not
confined to the Mediterranean, but also found in the Indian Ocean and
on the coast of Australia. Its skin is of a rich brown, beautifully
marked with large yellowish spots, each of which contains smaller brown
spots.</p>

<p><i>Gymnomuræna</i> differs from <i>Muræna</i> in having the fins

known growing to a length of eight feet.</p>

<p><i>Myroconger</i> and <i>Enchelycore</i> belong to the same sub-family<span class="pagenum" id="Page_678">[678]</span>
as <i>Muræna</i>, but the former is provided with pectoral fins, and in
the latter the posterior nostril is a long slit, and not round as in
the other genera.</p>


<h4>FIFTH ORDER—LOPHOBRANCHII.</h4>

<p><i>The gills are not laminated, but composed of small rounded lobes
attached to the branchial arches. Gill-cover reduced to a large simple
plate. Air-bladder simple, without pneumatic duct. A dermal skeleton
composed of numerous pieces arranged in segments, replaces more or less
soft integuments. Muscular system not much developed. Snout prolonged.
Mouth terminal, small, toothless, formed as in Acanthopterygians.</i></p>

<h6 class="smcap">First Family—Solenostomidæ.</h6>

<p><i>Gill-openings wide. Two dorsal fins, the rays of the anterior not
articulated. All the other fins well developed.</i></p>

<p>One living genus only is known, which was preceded in the tertiary
epoch by <i>Solenorhynchus</i> (Monte Postale).</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Solenostoma.</span>—Snout produced into a long tube. Body
compressed, with very short tail. All parts covered with
thin skin, below which there is a dermal skeleton formed by
large star-like ossifications. The soft dorsal and anal fins
on elevated bases; caudal fin long. Ventral fins inserted
opposite to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_679">[679]</span> anterior dorsal, close together, seven-rayed;
they are free in the male, but in the female their inner side
coalesces with the integuments of the body, a large pouch for
the reception of the eggs being formed thereby. Air-bladder
and pseudobranchiæ absent. Branchiostegals four, very thin.
Intestinal tract very simple, with a stomachic dilatation,
without pyloric appendages. Ova very small.</p>
</div>

<p>The dermal skeleton of this singular type is formed by star-like
ossifications, four in each horizontal and vertical series on the side
of the fore part of the trunk; each consists of four or three radiating
branches by which it joins the neighbouring bones; on the hind part
of the trunk and tail the series are diminished to two. The dorsal
and abdominal profiles in front of the fins are protected by similar
bones. The vertebral column is composed of eighteen abdominal and
fifteen caudal vertebræ, the vertebræ gradually decreasing in length
backwards, so that the shortness of the tail is caused not only by
the smaller number of vertebræ, but also by their much lesser length.
Neural and hæmal spines are developed. The pelvis consists of two pairs
of cartilaginous laminæ, the convex margin of the anterior fitting
into an angle of a dermal bone which separates the pelvis from the
well-ossified humeral arch.</p>

<p>The singular provision for the retention and protection of the eggs has
been described above (p. 162, figs. 73 and 74), and we have only to
repeat here that it is the female which takes care of the progeny, and
not the male as in the following family. Two or three small species are
known from the Indian Ocean; they are beautifully marked, especially
the male, which also appears to be of smaller size in this genus than
the female.</p>


<h6 class="smcap">Second Family—Syngnathidæ.</h6>

<p><i>Gill-openings reduced to a very small opening near the upper
posterior angle of the gill-cover. One soft dorsal fin; no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_680">[680]</span> ventrals,
and, sometimes, one or more of the other fins are also absent.</i></p>

<p>Small marine fishes, which are abundant on such parts of the coasts
of the tropical and temperate zones as offer by their vegetation
shelter to these defenceless creatures. They are bad swimmers (the
dorsal fin being the principal organ of locomotion), and frequently
and resistlessly carried by currents into the open ocean or to distant
coasts. All enter brackish water, some fresh water. The strata of Monte
Bolca and Licata (Sicily) have, yielded evidence of their existence
in the tertiary epochs; beside species of <i>Siphonostoma</i> and
<i>Syngnathus</i> (<i>Pseudosyngnathus</i>), remains of an extinct
genus, <i>Calamostoma</i>, allied to <i>Hippocampus</i>, but with a
distinct caudal fin, have been found. On their propagation see p. 163,
Fig. <a href="#fig76">76</a>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">A. Syngnathina.</span>—The tail is not prehensile, and
generally provided with a caudal fin.—<i>Pipe-Fishes.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Siphonostoma.</span>—Body with distinct ridges, the upper
caudal ridge continuous with the lateral line, but not with
the dorsal ridge of the trunk. Pectoral and caudal fins well
developed; dorsal fin of moderate length, opposite to the
vent. Humeral bones movable, not united into a “breast-ring.”
Males with an egg-pouch on the tail, the eggs being covered by
cutaneous folds.</p>
</div>

<p>Two species, of which <i>S. typhle</i> is common on the British, and
generally distributed on the European coasts.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Syngnathus.</span>—Body with the ridges more or less

with that of the tail. Pectoral fins well developed; caudal

bones firmly united into the breast-ring. Egg-pouch as in
<i>Siphonostoma</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>The distribution of this genus nearly coincides with that of the
family, some fifty species being known. <i>S. acus</i>, the great
Pipe-fish (see Fig. <a href="#fig75">75</a>, p. 163), is one of the most common European
fishes, extending across the Atlantic and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_681">[681]</span> southwards to the Cape
of Good Hope; it attains a length of 18 inches. Another very common
species, frequently met at sea, and spread over nearly all the tropical
and sub-tropical seas, is <i>S. pelagicus</i>, agreeably marked with
alternate brown and silvery cross-bars.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Doryichthys.</span>—Body with the ridges well developed.
Pectoral and caudal fins present. Dorsal fin long or of moderate
length, opposite to the vent. Humeral bones firmly united. Males
with the lower ridges of the abdomen dilated, the dilated parts
forming a broad groove for the reception of the ova.</p>
</div>

<p>In these Pipe-fishes the ova are not received in a completely closed
pouch, but glued on to the surface of the abdomen. Twenty species from
tropical seas.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Nerophis.</span>—Body smooth, rounded, with scarcely any
of the ridges distinct. Pectoral fin none, caudal absent or
rudimentary, the tail tapering into a point. Dorsal fin of
moderate length, opposite to the vent. The ova are attached to
the soft integument of the abdomen of the male, and are not
covered by lateral folds of the skin.</p>
</div>

<p>Seven species from the European seas and the Atlantic. <i>N.
æquoreus</i> (Ocean Pipe-fish), <i>N. ophidion</i> (Straight-nosed
Pipe-fish), and <i>N. lumbriciformis</i> (Little Pipe-fish), are common
on the British coasts.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Protocampus.</span>—The whole dermal skeleton is covered with
skin. A broad cutaneous fold runs along the back in front and
behind the dorsal; a similar fold along the abdomen. Pectoral
fin none; caudal very small.</p>
</div>

<p>The single species of this remarkable genus, <i>P. hymenolomus</i>,
occurs in the Falkland Islands. It may be regarded as an embryonal form
of <i>Nerophis</i>, the median skin-folds being evidently remains of
the fringe which surrounds the body of the embryo.</p>

<p>The other genera belonging to this group are, <i>Icthyocampus</i>,
<i>Nannocampus</i>, <i>Urocampus</i>, <i>Leptoichthys</i>,
<i>Coelonotus</i>, and <i>Stigmatophora</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_682">[682]</span></p>

</div>

<p>Three species from the coasts of Australia. The protective resemblances
with which many Lophobranchs are furnished, attain to the highest
degree of development in the fishes of this genus. Not only their
colour closely assimilates that of the particular kind of seaweed which
they frequent, but the appendages of their spines seem to be merely
part of the fucus to which they are attached. They attain a length of
12 inches.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Hippocampus.</span>—Trunk compressed, more or less elevated.
Shields with more or less prominent tubercles or spines. Occiput
compressed into a crest, terminating at its supero-posterior
corner in a prominent knob (coronet). Pectoral fins. The males
carry the eggs in a sac at the base of the tail, opening near
the vent.</p>
</div>

<p>A singular resemblance of the head and fore part of the body to that
of a horse, has given to these fishes the name of “Sea-horses.”
They are abundant between and near the tropics, becoming scarcer
in higher latitudes. Some twenty species are known, some of which
have a wide geographical range, as they are often carried to
great distances with floating objects to which they happen to
be attached.—<i>Acentronura</i> is a genus closely allied to
<i>Hippocampus</i>.</p>

Gills pectinate; a narrow gill-opening in front of the pectoral fins.
Mouth narrow; the bones of the upper jaw generally firmly united. A
soft dorsal fin, belonging to the caudal portion of the vertebral
column, opposite to the anal; sometimes elements of a spinous dorsal
besides. Ventral fin none, or reduced to spines. Air-bladder without
pneumatic duct.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_684">[684]</span></p>


<h6 class="smcap">First Family—Sclerodermi.</h6>

<p><i>Snout somewhat produced; jaws armed with distinct teeth in small
number. Skin with scutes or rough. The elements of a spinous dorsal and
ventral fins generally present.</i></p>

<p>Marine fishes of moderate or small size, very common in the tropical
zone, but scarcer in higher latitudes. They have been found in
three localities of tertiary strata, viz., at Monte Bolca, where a
species of <i>Ostracion</i> occurs, and in the Schists of Glaris,
from which two genera have been described, <i>Acanthoderma</i>
and <i>Acanthopleurus</i>, closely allied to <i>Balistes</i> and
<i>Triacanthus</i>. <i>Glyptocephalus</i> from the Isle of Sheppey
has the skull of a Balistes, but its body is covered with tubercles
arranged in regular series. The Scleroderms may be divided into three
very natural groups:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A. <span class="smcap">Triacanthina.</span>—The skin is covered with small,
rough, scale-like scutes. A spinous dorsal fin with from four to
six spines. A pair of strong, movable ventral spines, joined to
the pelvic bone.</p>
</div>

<p>To this group belong the genera <i>Triacanthodes</i>, <i>Hollardia</i>,
and <i>Triacanthus</i>, represented by five species, of which
<i>Triacanthus brevirostris</i> from the Indian Ocean is the most
common.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>B. <span class="smcap">Balistina.</span>—Body compressed, covered with movable
scutes or rough. Spinous dorsal reduced to one, two, or three
spines. Ventral fins reduced to a single pelvic prominence, or
entirely absent.</p>
</div>

<p>To this group belong the genera <i>Balistes</i>, <i>Monacanthus</i>,
and <i>Anacanthus</i>, the last genus being distinguished by a barbel
at the lower jaw.</p>

     <p class="p0 center smaller">Fig. 310.—Balistes vidua.</p>
  </div>

<p><i>Balistes</i>, or the “File-fishes” proper, inhabit the tropical
and sub-tropical seas; shoals of young are not rarely met with in
mid-ocean. Some thirty species are known, many attaining a length
exceeding two feet; but the majority are much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_685">[685]</span> smaller, and frequently
beautifully and symmetrically marked. Both jaws are armed with eight
strong incisor-like and obliquely truncated teeth, by which these
fishes are enabled to break off pieces of corals on which they feed,
or to chisel a hole into the hard shell of Mollusca, in order to
extract the soft parts. They destroy an immense number of Mollusks,
thus becoming most injurious to the pearl-fisheries. The first of their
three dorsal spines is very strong, roughened in front like a file,
and hollowed out behind to receive the second much smaller spine,
which, besides, has a projection in front, at its base, fitting into
a notch of the first. Thus these two spines can only be raised or
depressed simultaneously, and the first cannot be forced down, unless
the second has been previously depressed. The latter has been compared
to a trigger, hence a second name, “Trigger-fish,” has been given to
these fishes. Some species are armed with a series of short spines or
tubercles on each side of the tail. Two species (<i>B. maculatus</i>
and <i>B. capriscus</i>), common in the Atlantic, sometimes wander to
the British coasts.</p>

<p>The <i>Monacanthus</i> are similarly distributed as the
<i>Balistes</i>, and still more abundant, some fifty species being
known. Their dentition is very similar, but they possess one dorsal
spine only, and their rough scales are so small as to give a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_686">[686]</span> velvety
appearance to the skin (Figs. <a href="#fig17">17</a> and <a href="#fig18">18</a>, p. 48). Adult males of some of
the species possess a peculiar armature on each side of the tail, which
in females is much less developed or entirely absent. This armature may
consist either in simple spines arranged in rows, or in the development
of the minute spines of the scales into long stiff bristles, so that
the patch on each side of the tail looks like a brush.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>C. <span class="smcap">Ostraciontina.</span>—The integuments of the body form
a hard continuous carapace, consisting of hexagonal scutes
juxtaposed in mosaic-fashion. A spinous dorsal and ventral fins
are absent; but sometimes indicated by protuberances.</p>
</div>

<p>The “Coffer-fishes” (<i>Ostracion</i>) are too well known to require
a lengthened description. Only the snout, the bases of the fins, and
the hind part of the tail are covered with soft skin, so as to admit
of free action of the muscles moving these parts. The mouth is small,
the maxillary and intermaxillary bones coalescent, each jaw being armed
with a single series of small slender teeth. The short dorsal fin is
opposite to the equally short anal. The vertebral column consists of
fourteen vertebræ only, of which the five last are extremely short,
the anterior elongate. Ribs none. The carapaces of some species are
three-ridged, of others four- and five-ridged, of some provided with
long spines. Twenty-two species from tropical and sub-tropical seas are
known.</p>


<h6 class="smcap">Second Family—Gymnodontes.</h6>

<p><i>Body more or less shortened. The bones of the upper and lower
jaw are confluent, forming a beak with a trenchant edge, without
teeth, with or without median suture. A soft dorsal, caudal and anal
are developed, approximate. No spinous dorsal. Pectoral fins; no
ventrals.</i></p>

<p>Marine fishes of moderate or small size from tropical and sub-tropical
seas. A few species live in fresh water. Fossil remains of
<i>Diodon</i> are not scarce at Monte Bolca and Licata;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_687">[687]</span> a distinct
genus, <i>Enneodon</i>, has been described from Monte Postale. The
Gymnodonts may be divided into three groups:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A. <span class="smcap">Triodontina.</span>—Tail rather long, with a separate
caudal fin. Abdomen dilatable into a very large, compressed,
pendent sac, the lower part of which is merely a flap of skin,
into which the air does not penetrate, the sac being capable
of being expanded by the very long pelvic bone. The upper jaw
divided by a median suture, the lower simple.</p>
</div>

<p>A single genus and species (<i>Triodon bursarius</i>) from the Indian
Ocean.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>B. <span class="smcap">Tetrodontina.</span>—Tail and caudal fin distinct. Part of
the œsophagus much distensible, and capable of being filled with
air. No pelvic bone.</p>
</div>

<p>“Globe-fishes” have a short, thick, cylindrical body, with well
developed fins. It is covered with thick scaleless skin, in which,
however, spines are imbedded of various sizes. The spines are very
small, and but partially distributed over the body in some species,
whilst in others they are very large, and occupy equally every part
of the body. These fishes have the power of inflating their body by
filling their distensible œsophagus with air, and thus assume a more or
less globular form. The skin is, then, stretched to its utmost extent,
and the spines protrude and form a more or less formidable defensive
armour, as in a hedgehog; therefore they are frequently called
“Sea-hedgehogs.” A fish thus blown out turns over and floats belly
upwards, driving before the wind and waves. However, it is probable
that the spines are a protection not only when the fish is on the
surface and able to take in air, but also when it is under water. Some
Diodonts, at any rate, are able to erect the spines about the head by
means of cutaneous muscles; and, perhaps, all fill their stomach with
water instead of air, for the same purpose and with the same effect. In
some Diodonts the spines are fixed, erect, not movable. The Gymnodonts
generally, when taken,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_688">[688]</span> produce a sound, doubtless by the expulsion
of air from the œsophagus. Their vertebral column consists of a small
number of vertebræ, from 20 to 29, and their spinal chord is extremely
short. All these fishes have a bad reputation, and they are never
eaten; indeed, some of them are highly poisonous, and have caused long
continued illness and death. Singularly, the poisonous properties of
these fishes vary much as regards intensity, only certain individuals
of a species, or individuals from a certain locality, or caught at a
certain time of the year, being dangerous. Therefore it is probable
that they acquire their poisonous quality from their food, which
consists in corals and hard-shelled Mollusks and Crustaceans. Their
sharp beaks, with broad masticating posterior surface, are admirably
adapted for breaking off branchlets of coral-stocks, and for crushing
hard substances.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Tetrodon</span> (including <i>Xenopterus</i>).—Both the upper
and lower jaws are divided into two by a mesial suture.</p>
</div>

<p>Extremely numerous in tropical and sub-tropical zones, more than
sixty species being known. In some of the species the dermal
spines are extremely small, and may be absent altogether. Many are
highly ornamented with spots or bands. A few species live in large
rivers—thus <i>T. psittacus</i> from Brazil; <i>T. fahaka</i>, a fish
well known to travellers on the Nile, and likewise abundant in West
African rivers; <i>T. fluvi</i><i>atilis</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_689">[689]</span> from brackish water and
rivers of the East Indies. The species figured is one of the smallest,
about six inches long, and common in the Indo-Pacific.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Diodon.</span>—Jaws without mesial suture, so that there is
only one undivided dental plate above and one below.</p>
</div>

<p>In these fishes, as well as in some closely allied genera, the dermal
spines are much more developed than in the Tetrodonts; in some the
spines are erectile, as in <i>Diodon</i>, <i>Atopomycterus</i>,
<i>Trichodiodon</i>, and <i>Trichocyclus</i>; in others they are stiff
and immovable, as in <i>Chilomycterus</i> and <i>Dicotylichthys</i>.
Seventeen species are known, of which <i>Diodon hystrix</i> is the most
common as it is the largest, growing to a length of two feet. It is
spread over the Tropical Atlantic as well as Indo-Pacific, as is also a
smaller, but almost equally common species, <i>Diodon maculatus</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>The “Sun-fishes” (<i>Orthagoriscus</i>) are pelagic fishes, found in
every part of the oceans within the tropical and temperate zones.
The singular shape of their body and the remarkable changes which
they undergo with age, have been noticed above (p. 175, Figs. <a href="#fig93">93</a>,
<a href="#fig97">94</a>). Their jaws are undivided in the middle, comparatively feeble,
but well adapted for masticating their food, which consists of small
pelagic Crustaceans. Two species are known. The common Sun-fish,
<i>O. mola</i>, which attains to a very large size, measuring seven
or eight feet, and weighing as many hundredweights. It has a rough,
minutely granulated skin. It frequently approaches the southern coasts
of England and the coasts of Ireland, and is seen basking in calm
weather on the surface. The second species, <i>O. truncatus</i>, is
distinguished by its smooth, tessellated skin, and one of the scarcest
fishes in collections. The shortness of the vertebral column of the
Sun-fishes, in which the number of caudal vertebra is reduced to seven,
the total number being seventeen, and the still more reduced length of
the spinal chord have been noticed above (p. 96).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_691">[691]</span></p>


<h3>THIRD SUB-CLASS—CYCLOSTOMATA.</h3>

<p><i>Skeleton cartilaginous and notochordal, without ribs and without
real jaws. Skull not separate from the vertebral column. No limbs.
Gills in the form of fixed sacs, without branchial arches, six or seven
in number on each side. One nasal aperture only. Heart without bulbus
arteriosus. Mouth anterior, surrounded by a circular or subcircular
lip, suctorial. Alimentary canal straight, simple, without coecal
appendages, pancreas or spleen. Generative outlet peritoneal. Vertical
fins rayed.</i></p>

<p>The Cyclostomes are most probably a very ancient type. Unfortunately
the organs of these creatures are too soft to be preserved, with the
exception of the horny denticles with which the mouth of some of them
is armed. And, indeed, dental plates, which are very similar to those
of <i>Myxine</i>, are not uncommon in certain strata of Devonian and
Silurian age (see p. 193). The fishes belonging to this sub-class may
be divided into two families—</p>


<h6 class="smcap">First Family—Petromyzontidæ.</h6>

<p><i>Body eel-shaped, naked. Subject to a metamorphosis; in the perfect
stage with a suctorial mouth armed with teeth, simple or multicuspid,
horny, sitting on a soft papilla. Maxillary, mandibulary, lingual, and
suctorial teeth may be distinguished. Eyes present (in mature animals).
External nasal aperture in the middle of the upper side of the head.
The nasal duct terminates without perforating the palate. Seven
branchial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_692">[692]</span> sacs and apertures on each side behind the head; the inner
branchial ducts terminate in a separate common tube. Intestine with a
spiral valve. Eggs small. The larvæ without teeth, and with a single
continuous vertical fin.</i></p>

<p>“Lampreys” are found in the rivers and on the coasts of the temperate
regions of the northern and southern hemispheres. Their habits are but
incompletely known, but so much is certain that at least some of them
ascend rivers periodically, for the purpose of spawning, and that the
young pass several years in rivers, whilst they undergo a metamorphosis
(see p. 170). They feed on other fishes, to which they suck themselves
fast, scraping off the flesh with their teeth. Whilst thus engaged they
are carried about by their victim; Salmon have been captured in the
middle course of the Rhine with the Marine Lamprey attached to them.</p>

with the caudal. The maxillary dentition consists of two teeth
placed close together, or of a transverse bicuspid ridge;

</div>

<p>The Lampreys belonging to this genus are found in the northern
hemisphere only; the British species are the Sea-Lamprey (<i>P.
marinus</i>), exceeding a length of three feet, and not uncommon on the
European and North American coasts; the River-Lamprey or Lampern (<i>P.
fluviatilis</i>), ascending in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_693">[693]</span> large numbers the rivers of Europe,
North America, and Japan, and scarcely attaining a length of two feet;
the “Pride” or “Sand-Piper” or Small Lampern (<i>P. branchialis</i>),
scarcely twelve inches long, the larva of which has been long known
under the name of <i>Ammocoetes</i>.</p>

<p><i>Ichthyomyzon</i> from the western coasts of North America is said to
have a tricuspid maxillary tooth.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

</div>

<p>Two species, one from Chile and one from South Australia. They grow
to a length of two feet, and in some specimens the skin of the throat
is much expanded, forming a large pouch. Its physiological function
is not known. The cavity is in the subcutaneous cellular tissue, and
does not communicate with the buccal or branchial cavities. Probably
it is developed with age, and absent in young individuals. In all
the localities in which these Extra-european Lampreys are found,
<i>Ammocoetes</i> forms occur, so that there is little doubt that they
undergo a similar metamorphosis as <i>P. branchialis</i>.</p>


<h6 class="smcap">Second Family—myxinidæ.</h6>

<p><i>Body eel-shaped, naked. The single nasal aperture is above the
mouth, quite at the extremity of the head, which is provided with four
pairs of barbels. Mouth without lips. Nasal duct without cartilaginous
rings, penetrating the palate. One median tooth on the palate, and
two comb-like series of teeth on the tongue</i> (see Fig. <a href="#fig101">101</a>).
<i>Branchial apertures at a great distance from the head; the inner
branchial ducts lead into the œsophagus. A series of mucous sacs along
each side of the abdomen. Intestine without spiral valve. Eggs large,
with a horny case provided with threads for adhesion.</i></p>

<p>The fishes of this family are known by the names of “Hag-Fish,”
“Glutinous Hag,” or “Borer;” they are marine fishes with a similar
distribution as the Gadidæ, being most plentiful in the higher
latitudes of the temperate zones of the northern and southern
hemispheres. They are frequently found buried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_695">[695]</span> in the abdominal cavity
of other fishes, especially Gadoids, into which they penetrate to feed
on their flesh. They secrete a thick glutinous slime in incredible
quantities, and are therefore considered by fishermen a great nuisance,
seriously damaging the fisheries and interfering with the fishing in
localities where they abound. <i>Myxine</i> descends to a depth of
345 fathoms, and is generally met with in the Norwegian Fjords at 70
fathoms, sometimes in great abundance.</p>

<p><i>Skeleton membrano-cartilaginous and notochordal, ribless. No brain.
Pulsating sinuses in place of a heart. Blood colourless. Respiratory
cavity confluent with the abdominal cavity; branchial clefts in great
number, the water being expelled by an opening in front of the vent.
Jaws none.</i></p>

<p>This sub-class is represented by a single family (<i>Cirrostomi</i>)
and by a single genus (<i>Branchiostoma</i>);<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> it is the lowest in
the scale of fishes, and lacks so many characteristics, not only of
this class, but of the vertebrata generally, that Hæckel, with good
reason, separates it into a separate class, that of <i>Acrania</i>. The
various parts of its organisation have been duly noticed in the first
part of this work.</p>

<p>The “Lancelet” (<i>Branchiostoma lanceolatum</i>, see Fig. <a href="#fig28">28</a>, p. 63),
seems to be almost cosmopolitan within the temperate and tropical
zones. Its small size, its transparency, and the rapidity with which it
is able to bury itself in the sand, are the causes why it escapes so
readily observation, even at localities where it is known to be common.
Shallow, sandy parts of the coasts seem to be the places on which it
may be looked for. It has been found on many localities of the British,
and generally European coasts, in North America, the West Indies,
Brazil, Peru, Tasmania, Australia, and Borneo. It rarely exceeds
a length of three inches. A smaller species, in which the dorsal
fringe is distinctly higher and rayed, and in which the caudal fringe
is absent, has been described under the name of <i>Epigionichthys
pulchellus</i>; it was found in Moreton Bay.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center smaller">DIRECTIONS FOR COLLECTING AND PRESERVING FISHES.</p>


<p>Whenever practicable fishes ought to be preserved in spirits.</p>

<p>To insure success in preserving specimens the best and strongest
spirits should be procured, which, if necessary, can be reduced to
the strength required during the journey with water or weaker spirit.
Travellers frequently have great difficulties in procuring spirits
during their journey, and therefore it is advisable, especially during
sea voyages, that the traveller should take a sufficient quantity
with him. Pure spirits of wine is best. Methylated spirits may be
recommended on account of their cheapness; however, specimens do not
keep equally well in this fluid, and very valuable objects, or such as
are destined for minute anatomical examination, should always be kept
in pure spirits of wine. If the collector has exhausted his supply of
spirits he may use arrack, cognac, or rum, provided that the fluids
contain a sufficient quantity of alcohol. Generally speaking, spirits
which, without being previously heated, can be ignited by a match or
taper, may be used for the purposes of conservation. The best method
to test the strength of the spirits is the use of a hydrometer. It
is immersed in the fluid to be measured, and the deeper it sinks the
stronger is the spirit. On its scale the number 0 signifies what is
called proof spirit, the lowest degree of strength which can be used
for the conservation of fish for any length of time. Spirits, in which
specimens are packed permanently, should be from 40 to 60 above proof.
If the hydrometers are made of glass they are easily broken, and
therefore the traveller had better provide himself with three or four
of them, their cost being very trifling. Further, the collector<span class="pagenum" id="Page_698">[698]</span> will
find a small distilling apparatus very useful. By its means he is able
not only to distil weak and deteriorated spirits or any other fluid
containing alcohol, but also, in case of necessity, to prepare a small
quantity of drinkable spirits.</p>

<p>Of collecting vessels we mention first those which the collector
requires for daily use. Most convenient are four-sided boxes made of
zinc, 18 in. high, 12 in. broad, and 5 in. wide. They have a round
opening at the top of 4 in. diameter, which can be closed by a strong
cover of zinc of 5 in. diameter, the cover being screwed into a raised
rim round the opening. In order to render the cover air-tight, an
indiarubber ring is fixed below its margin. Each of these zinc boxes
fits into a wooden case, the lid of which is provided with hinges and
fastenings, and which on each side has a handle of leather or rope, so
that the box can be easily shifted from one place to another. These
boxes are in fact made from the pattern of the ammunition cases used
in the British army, and extremely convenient, because a pair can be
easily carried strapped over the shoulders of a man or across the
back of a mule. The collector requires at least two, still better
four or six, of these boxes. All those specimens which are received
during the day are deposited in them, in order to allow them to be
thoroughly penetrated by the spirit, which must be renewed from time
to time. They remain there for some time under the supervision of the
collector, and are left in these boxes until they are hardened and
fit for final packing. Of course, other more simple vessels can be
used and substituted for the collecting boxes. For instance, common
earthenware vessels, closed by a cork or an indiarubber covering,
provided they have a wide mouth at the top, which can be closed so
that the spirit does not evaporate, and which permits of the specimens
being inspected at any moment without trouble. Vessels in which the
objects are permanently packed for the home journey are zinc boxes of
various sizes, closely fitting into wooden cases. Too large a size
should be avoided, because the objects themselves may suffer from the
superimposed weight, and the risk of injury to the case increases with
its size. It should hold no more than 18 cubic feet at most, and what,
in accordance with the size of the specimens, has to be added in length
should be deducted in depth or breadth.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_699">[699]</span> The most convenient cases,
but not sufficient for all specimens, are boxes 2 feet in length, 1½
foot broad, and 1 foot deep. The traveller may provide himself with
such cases ready made, packing in them other articles which he wants
during his journey; or he may find it more convenient to take with him
only the zinc plates cut to the several sizes, and join them into boxes
when they are actually required. The requisite wooden cases can be
procured without much difficulty almost everywhere. No collector should
be without the apparatus and materials for soldering, and he should be
well acquainted with their use. Also a pair of scissors to cut the zinc
plates are useful.</p>

<p>Wooden casks are not suitable for the packing of specimens preserved
in spirits, at least not in tropical climates. They should be used in
cases of necessity only, or for packing of the largest examples, or for
objects preserved in salt or brine.</p>

<p>Very small and delicate specimens should never be packed together with
larger ones, but separately, in small bottles.</p>

<p><i>Mode of preserving.</i>—All fishes, with the exception of very
large ones (broad kinds exceeding 3–4 feet in length; eel-like kinds
more than 6 feet long), should be preserved in spirits. A deep cut
should be made in the abdomen between the pectoral fins, another in
front of the vent, and one or two more, according to the length of
the fish, along the middle line of the abdomen. These cuts are made
partly to remove the fluid and easily decomposing contents of the
intestinal tract, partly to allow the spirit quickly to penetrate into
the interior. In large fleshy fishes several deep incisions should
be made with the scalpel into the thickest parts of the dorsal and
caudal muscles, to give ready entrance to the spirits. The specimens
are then placed in one of the provisional boxes, in order to extract,
by means of the spirit, the water of which fishes contain a large
quantity. After a few days (in hot climates after 24 or 48 hours) the
specimens are transferred into a second box with stronger spirits, and
left therein for several days. A similar third and, in hot climates
sometimes a fourth, transfer is necessary. This depends entirely on
the condition of the specimens. If, after ten or fourteen days of
such treatment the specimens are firm and in good condition, they may
be left in the spirits last used until they are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_700">[700]</span> finally packed. But
if they should be soft, very flexible, and discharge a discoloured
bloody mucus, they must be put back in spirits at least 20° over proof.
Specimens showing distinct signs of decomposition should be thrown
away, as they imperil all other specimens in the same vessel. Neither
should any specimen in which decomposition has commenced when found, be
received for the collecting boxes, unless it be of a very rare species,
when the attempt may be made to preserve it separately in the strongest
spirits available. The fresher the specimens to be preserved are, the
better is the chance of keeping them in a perfect condition. Specimens
which have lost their scales, or are otherwise much injured, should not
be kept. Herring-like fishes, and others with deciduous scales, are
better wrapped in thin paper or linen before being placed in spirits.</p>

<p>The spirits used during this all-important process of preservation
loses, of course, gradually in strength. As long as it keeps 10° under
proof it may still be used for the first stage of preservation, but
weaker spirits should be re-distilled; or, if the collector cannot do
this, it should be at least filtered through powdered charcoal before
it is mixed with stronger spirits. Many collectors are satisfied with
removing the thick sediment collected at the bottom of the vessel,
and use their spirits over and over again without removing from it by
filtration the decomposing matter with which it has been impregnated,
and which entirely neutralises the preserving property of the spirits.
The result is generally the loss of the collection on its journey
home. The collector can easily detect the vitiated character of his
spirits by its bad smell. He must frequently examine his specimens; and
attention to the rules given, with a little practice and perseverance,
after the possible failure of the first trial, will soon insure to
him the safety of his collected treasures. The trouble of collecting
specimens in spirits is infinitely less than that of preserving skins
or dry specimens of any kind.</p>

<p>When a sufficient number of well-preserved examples have been brought
together, they should be sent home by the earliest opportunity. Each
specimen should be wrapped separately in a piece of linen, or at least
soft paper; the specimens are then packed as close as herrings in the
zinc case, so that no free space<span class="pagenum" id="Page_701">[701]</span> is left either at the top or on the
sides. When the case is full, the lid is soldered on, with a round
hole about half an inch in diameter near one of the corners. This hole
is left in order to pour the spirit through it into the case. Care is
taken to drive out the air which may remain between the specimens,
and to surround them completely with spirits, until the case is quite
full. Finally, the hole is closed by a small square lid of tin being
soldered over it. In order to see whether the case keeps in the spirit
perfectly, it is turned upside down and left over night. When all is
found to be securely fastened, the zinc case is placed into the wooden
box and ready for transport.</p>

<p>Now and then it happens in tropical climates that collectors are unable
to keep fishes from decomposition even in the strongest spirits without
being able to detect the cause. In such cases a remedy will be found in
mixing a small quantity of arsenic or sublimate with the spirits; but
the collector ought to inform his correspondent, or the recipient of
the collection, of this admixture having been made.</p>

<p>In former times fishes of every kind, even those of small size, were
preserved dry as flat skins or stuffed. Specimens thus prepared admit
of a very superficial examination only, and therefore this method of
conservation has been abandoned in all larger museums, and should be
employed exceptionally only, for instance on long voyages overland,
during which, owing to the difficulty of transport, neither spirits
nor vessels can be carried. To make up as much as possible for the
imperfection of such specimens, the collector ought to sketch the
fish before it is skinned, and to colour the sketch if the species
is ornamented with colours likely to disappear in the dry example.
Collectors who have the requisite time and skill, ought to accompany
their collections with drawings coloured from the living fishes; but
at the same time it must be remembered that, valuable as such drawings
are if accompanied by the originals from which they were made, they can
never replace the latter, and possess a subordinate scientific value
only.</p>

<p>Very large fishes can be preserved as skins only; and collectors are
strongly recommended to prepare in this manner the largest examples
obtainable, although it will entail some trouble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_702">[702]</span> and expense. So
very few large examples are exhibited in museums, the majority of the
species being known from the young stage only, that the collector will
find himself amply recompensed by attending to these desiderata.</p>

<p>Scaly fishes are skinned thus: with a strong pair of scissors an
incision is made along the median line of the abdomen from the foremost
part of the throat, passing on one side of the base of the ventral
and anal fins, to the root of the caudal fin, the cut being continued
upwards to the back of the tail close to the base of the caudal. The
skin of one side of the fish is then severed with the scalpel from the
underlying muscles to the median line of the back; the bones which
support the dorsal and caudal are cut through, so that these fins
remain attached to the skin. The removal of the skin of the opposite
side is easy. More difficult is the preparation of the head and
scapulary region; the two halves of the scapular arch which have been
severed from each other by the first incision are pressed towards the
right and left, and the spine is severed behind the head, so that now
only the head and shoulder bones remain attached to the skin. These
parts have to be cleaned from the inside, all soft parts, the branchial
and hyoid apparatus, and all smaller bones, being cut away with the
scissors or scraped off with the scalpel. In many fishes, which
are provided with a characteristic dental apparatus in the pharynx
(Labroids, Cyprinoids), the pharyngeal bones ought to be preserved,
and tied with a thread to the specimen. The skin being now prepared so
far, its entire inner surface as well as the inner side of the head are
rubbed with arsenical soap; cotton-wool, or some other soft material is
inserted into any cavities or hollows, and finally a thin layer of the
same material is placed between the two flaps of the skin. The specimen
is then dried under a slight weight to keep it from shrinking.</p>

<p>The scales of some fishes, as for instance of many kinds of herrings,
are so delicate and deciduous that the mere handling causes them to rub
off easily. Such fishes may be covered with thin paper (tissue-paper
is the best), which is allowed to dry on them before skinning. There
is no need for removing the paper before the specimen has reached its
destination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_703">[703]</span></p>

<p>Scaleless Fishes, as Siluroids and Sturgeons, are skinned in the same
manner, but the skin can be rolled up over the head; such skins can
also be preserved in spirits, in which case the traveller may save to
himself the trouble of cleaning the head.</p>

<p>Some Sharks are known to attain to a length of 30 feet, and some Rays
to a width of 20 feet. The preservation of such gigantic specimens is
much to be recommended, and although the difficulties of preserving
fishes increase with their size, the operation is facilitated, because
the skins of all Sharks and Rays can easily be preserved in salt and
strong brine. Sharks are skinned much in the same way as ordinary
fishes. In Rays an incision is made not only from the snout to the end
of the fleshy part of the tail, but also a second across the widest
part of the body. When the skin is removed from the fish, it is placed
into a cask with strong brine mixed with alum, the head occupying the
upper part of the cask; this is necessary, because this part is most
likely to show signs of decomposition, and therefore most requires
supervision. When the preserving fluid has become decidedly weaker from
the extracted blood and water, it is thrown away and replaced by fresh
brine. After a week’s or fortnight’s soaking the skin is taken out of
the cask to allow the fluid to drain off; its inner side is covered
with a thin layer of salt, and after being rolled up (the head being
inside) it is packed in a cask, the bottom of which is covered with
salt; all the interstices and the top are likewise filled with salt.
The cask must be perfectly water-tight.</p>

<p>Of all larger examples of which the skin is prepared, the measurements
should be taken before skinning so as to guide the taxidermist in
stuffing and mounting the specimens.</p>

<p>Skeletons of large osseous fishes are as valuable as their skins. To
preserve them it is only necessary to remove the soft parts of the
abdominal cavity and the larger masses of muscle, the bones being left
in their natural continuity. The remaining flesh is allowed to dry on
the bones, and can be removed by proper maceration at home. The fins
ought to be as carefully attended to as in a skin, and of scaly fishes
so much of the external skin ought to be preserved as is necessary
for the determination of the species, as otherwise it is generally
impossible to determine more than the genus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_704">[704]</span></p>

<p>A few remarks may be added as regards those Faunæ, which promise most
results to the explorer, with some hints as to desirable information on
the life and economic value of fishes.</p>

<p>It is surprising to find how small the number is of the freshwater
faunæ which may be regarded as well explored; the rivers of Central
Europe, the Lower Nile, the lower and middle course of the Ganges,
and the lower part of the Amazons are almost the only fresh waters
in which collections made without discrimination would not reward
the naturalist. The oceanic areas are much better known; yet almost
everywhere novel forms can be discovered and new observations
made. Most promising and partly quite unknown are the following
districts:—the Arctic Ocean, all coasts south of 38° lat. S., the
Cape of Good Hope, the Persian Gulf, the coasts of Australia (with the
exception of Tasmania, New South Wales, and New Zealand), many of the
little-visited groups of Pacific islands, the coasts of north-eastern
Asia north of 35° lat. N., and the western coasts of North and South
America.</p>

<p>No opportunity should be lost to obtain <i>pelagic</i> forms,
especially the young larva-like stages of development abounding on the
surface of the open ocean. They can be obtained without difficulty by
means of a small narrow meshed net dragged behind the ship. The sac
of the net is about 3 feet deep, and fastened to a strong brass-ring
2 or 2½ feet in diameter. The net is suspended by three lines passing
into the strong main line. It can only be used when the vessel moves
very slowly, its speed not exceeding three knots an hour, or when a
current passes the ship whilst at anchor. To keep the net in a vertical
position the ring can be weighted at one point of its circumference;
and by using heavier weights two or three drag-nets can be used
simultaneously at different depths. This kind of fishing should be
tried at night as well as day, as many fishes come to the surface only
after sunset. The net must not be left long in the water, from 5 to 20
minutes only, as delicate objects would be sure to be destroyed by the
force of the water passing through the meshes.</p>

<p>Objects found floating on the surface, as wood, baskets, seaweed,
etc., deserve the attention of the travellers, as they are generally
surrounded by small fishes or other marine animals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_705">[705]</span></p>

<p>It is of the greatest importance to note the longitude and latitude at
which the objects were collected in the open ocean.</p>

<p>Fishing in great depths by means of the dredge, can be practised
only from vessels specially fitted out for the purpose; and the
success which attended the “Challenger,” and North American Deep-sea
explorations, has developed Deep-sea fishing into such a speciality
that the requisite information can be gathered better by consulting the
reports of those expeditions than from a general account, such as could
be given in the present work.</p>

<p>Fishes offer an extraordinary variety with regard to their habits,
growth, etc., so that it is impossible to enumerate in detail the
points of interest to which the travellers should pay particular
attention. However, the following hints may be useful.</p>

<p>Above all, detailed accounts are desirable of all fishes forming
important articles of trade, or capable of becoming more generally
useful than they are at present. Therefore, deserving of special
attention are the Sturgeons, Gadoids, Thyrsites and Chilodactylus,
Salmonoids, Clupeoids. Wherever these fishes are found in sufficient
abundance, new sources may be opened to trade.</p>

<p>Exact observations should be made on the fishes the flesh of which is
poisonous either constantly or at certain times and certain localities;
the cause of the poisonous qualities as well as the nature of the
poison should be ascertained. Likewise the poison of fishes provided
with special poison-organs requires to be experimentally examined,
especially with regard to its effects on other fishes and animals
generally.</p>

<p>All observations directed to sex, mode of propagation, and development,
will have special interest: thus those relating to secondary sexual
characters, hermaphroditism, numeric proportion of the sexes, time of
spawning and migration, mode of spawning, construction of nests, care
of progeny, change of form during growth, etc.</p>

<p>If the collector is unable to preserve the largest individuals of a
species that may come under his observation he should note at least
their measurements. There are but few species of fishes of which the
limit of growth is known.</p>

<p>The history of Parasitic Fishes is almost unknown, and any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_706">[706]</span>
observations with regard to their relation to their host as well as to
their early life will prove to be valuable; nothing is known of the
propagation of fishes even so common as Echeneis and Fierasfer, much
less of the parasitic Freshwater Siluroids.</p>

<p>The temperature of the blood of the larger freshwater and marine
species should be exactly measured.</p>

<p>Many pelagic and deep-sea fishes are provided with peculiar small
round organs of a mother-of-pearl colour, distributed in series along
the side of the body, especially along the abdomen. Some zoologists
consider these organs as accessory eyes, others (and it appears to
us with better reason) as luminous organs. They deserve an accurate
microscopic examination made on fresh specimens; and their function
should be ascertained from observation of the living fishes, especially
also with regard to the question, whether or not the luminosity (if
such be their function) is subject to the will of the fish.</p>

the latter, in which nothing whatever of the (probably very soft)

other order lower in the scale of organisation than the Ganoids (for

conditions. Dr. H. A. Meyer has made observations on young Herrings.
Individuals living in the sea had attained at the end of the third
month a length of 45 to 50 millimetres, whilst those reared from
artificially-impregnated ova were only from 30 to 35 millimetres long.
When the latter had been supplied with more abundant food, they grew
proportionally more rapidly in the following months, so that at the end
of the fifth month they had reached the same length as their brethren
in the sea, viz. a length of 65 to 70 millimetres.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_41" href="#FNanchor_41" class="label">[41]</a> The Acanthopterygians do not form a perfectly natural
group, some heterogeneous elements being mixed up with it. Neither are
the characters, by which it is circumscribed, absolutely distinctive.
In some forms (certain Blennioids) the structure of the fins is
almost the same as in Anacanths; there are some Acanthopterygians, as
<i>Gerres</i>, <i>Pogonias</i>, which possess coalesced pharyngeals;
and, finally, the presence or absence of a pneumatic duct loses much of
its value as a taxonomic character when we consider that probably in
all fishes a communication between pharynx and air-bladder exists at an
early stage of development.</p>

of prey, follow the shoals of young and adult Clupeoids in their
periodical migrations; on the British coasts it is principally the fry
of the Pilchard and Sprat which wanders from the open sea towards the
coast, and guides the movements of the Mackerel.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_44" href="#FNanchor_44" class="label">[44]</a> The systematic affinities of these extinct genera
are very obscure. Cope places them, with others (for instance
<i>Protosphyræna</i>, which has a sword-like prolongation of the
ethmoid), in a distinct family, <i>Saurodontidæ</i>: see “Vertebrata of
the Cretaceous Formations of the West,” 1875.</p>
